**13 Aging and communication across cultures** 

**Abstract:** This chapter examines and overviews research on aging and communica tion conducted in various corners of the world, and illuminates critical issues such as age stereotypes, the changing roles of family and older person norms, intra- and intergenerational communication perceptions in general, and the subjective health implications of intra- and intergenerational communication. Against the backdrop of rapid technological advancement and societal structural transformation, old age has increasingly been associated with negative meanings, especially in so-called Eastern countries, where the tradition of respect for older adults has been eroding. Under such circumstances, younger adults are likely to struggle and be dissatisfied in their communication with older adults, who consider communication with the latter to be rather problematic. Turning to the workplace, which has more recently garnered scholastic attention from intergenerational scholars, older adults tend to suffer from negative age stereotypes and discrimination in this context too. This chapter thus provides a synthesis of research on intergenerational communication across cultures both in and out of the workplace, and sets the stage for the promo tion of a more positive and interactional intergenerational climate.

**1 Introduction** 

Between 2000 and 2050, the proportion of the world’s population over 60 years will double from about 11 % to 22 %, with the number of people aged 60 years and above expected to reach 2 billion by 2050 (from close to 700 million today). In other words, it is projected that approximately 1 in 5 people around the world will be 60 years or above within 35 years (World Health Organization 2014). This emerg ing “silver tsunami” or “age-quake” has spawned political, media, and academic interest in the cultural conditions and processes of aging, as well as academic jour nals such as the *Journal of Cross Cultural Gerontology* and the *International Journal of Aging and Human Development* largely devoted to the topic. 

While there is a great amount of uncertainty about how societies, governments, organizations and families will cope with the rapid increase of older people, one issue remains certain as we consider these changes. This is that communication, whether mediated, face-to-face, or other, will remain at the heart of how we relate to and interact with those of the same and different ages and in ways that can, correspondingly, have significant and profound effects on successful aging (Giles,

Gasiorek & Giles 2013). The more that we can understand how people of different generations communicate (and perceive their communication) with each other, the better poised we are to craft solutions for the intergenerational opportunities and challenges of now and of the future across cultures. 

As governments across the world debate and implement major policy decisions in areas including retirement age, pensions, workplace safety, age discrimination, eldercare, healthcare and the mandating of care to aging parents, it is inevitable that such dynamics will set up many new challenges and opportunities for the study of intergenerational interaction, culture, and communication. We can expect that culture-specific modes (and social perspectives) of communication and aging will hold an increasingly prominent place in the gerontological, organizational, and intercultural communication literatures (to name but a few) as researchers attempt to better understand the global flows and exchanges of people, products, technology, ideas, ways of thought, and information. This chapter is intended to provide a synthesis of research on intergenerational communication across cul tures, especially from the viewpoint of intergroup communication. In the sections that follow, we discuss age and its interplay with stereotyping, norms, and percep tions of communication, together with their health implications. 

Prior to the last 10–15 years, most intergenerational communication research (as well as the theories formulated to account for it) was undeniably Western- and Anglo-centric. The research was largely conducted from a young adult’s perspec tive, and primarily with Anglo-European participants from Canada, Britain, Austra lia, New Zealand, and the USA, where the primary values are best described as rooted in individualism and independence (Triandis 1995; Markus & Kitayama 1991). 

With this milieu in mind, several researchers set out to explore different modes of intergenerational interaction to discover if the conclusions drawn in Anglophone societies held true elsewhere, and along the way, eliminate some of the existing Western bias in this line of research (for review, see Giles et al. 2002). An additional goal, whether implicitly or explicitly stated in many of these studies, was to investi gate whether cross-cultural comparisons might point to cultures where intergener ational interactions were more positive and, hence, provide ideas for solutions to problematic intergenerational interaction. Interestingly, as we will detail shortly, this so-called “positive intergenerational dynamic” was not necessarily found in the places (cultures) that one might expect. 

The cross-cultural communication and aging literature, as seen from an inter group communication perspective (e.g., Harwood, Giles & Ryan 1995), is generally divided into four areas, these being: 

– Age group stereotypes across cultures 

– Communication and the changing role of the family and older person norms (including filial piety) across cultures 

– Intra- and intergenerational communication perceptions across cultures in general and in the workplace

– The subjective health implications of aging and communication (including cul tural considerations) 

The first two areas (age group stereotypes and respect norms) can be seen as the “building blocks” for research into areas three and four (intra- and intergeneration al communication perceptions and the subjective health implications of aging and communication). 

**2 Age group stereotypes across cultures** 

**2.1 Culture and age group stereotypes** 

Age group stereotypes have significant implications for one’s communication with members of different age groups (e.g., Hummert 2010). Theoretical frameworks such as the communicative predicament of aging (CPA: Ryan, Giles, Bartolucci & Henwood 1986), the stereotype activation model (e.g., Hummert 2012\) and variants of these frameworks (e.g., Barker, Giles & Harwood 2004\) highlight the role of posi tive and negative stereotypes in guiding actual communicative behaviors to older adults. 

Empirical research into Western cultural attitudes toward elders, including traits and stereotypes, has been conducted for several decades and has indicated that elders are viewed very negatively (e.g., Kite & Johnson 1988). These stereo types include perceptions of older adults as being nagging, irritable, decrepit, cranky, weak, feeble-minded, verbose, cognitively deficient, asexual, useless, ugly, miserable, and unsatisfied with their lives. Age stereotypes for those in the younger age groups tend to be comparatively more positive (Lockenhoff et al. 2009). In line with Western societies being depicted as “youth-oriented,” comparative data have led to the suggestion that “young American adults enjoy being young much more and maintain higher life satisfaction than do Japanese youths” (Ota, Harwood, Wil liams & Takai 2000: 38). 

However, evidence has emerged of both positive and negative sub-stereotypes associated with elderly people) in research using trait sorting tasks and experimen tal manipulations (Hummert et al. 1994). The findings from this study identified various types of elderly people, isolated into four predominantly negative sub-ste reotypes (severely impaired, despondent, shrew/curmudgeon, and recluse) and three positive sub-stereotypes (perfect grandparent, John Wayne conservative, and golden ager). 

Many Asian cultures have been traditionally characterized as having more positive attitudes toward old age (Tobin 1987), a stereotype that is grounded in Confucian ideals of filial piety (or *Xiao*: Ho 1994; Yum 1988). In particular, in creased age is accompanied by greater respect, wisdom, and even tremendous so-

cial power in certain Asian cultures (Park and Kim 1992). Some research has posit ed that respect norms in East Asia are associated with reduced levels of negative stereotyping as compared to the West (Levy and Langer 1994). From this, one might predict that, in stark contrast to prior (Western) findings in this field, older people in East Asian cultures would be viewed more positively and that the communica tion climate between younger and older adults would be one of mutual accommo dation. 

Interestingly, on various dimensions of age stereotypes, an increasingly large body of research has emerged consistently whereby Eastern respondents were found to espouse a less favorable image of older people than their Western counter parts. First, one study showed, perhaps surprisingly, that there were no differences in young adults’ stereotypes about the young, middle-aged, and elderly across Ca nada, South Korea, Philippines, USA, and New Zealand (Harwood et al. 1996). In a sample of over 1,000 students, ratings of activity, strength, and the like declined with increasing age whereas ratings of wisdom and generosity increased compa rably (for additional research on the traits of wisdom and culture, see Grossmann et al. 2012). The Hong Kong sample (in the Harwood et al study above) displayed far more negative images than any of the foregoing, with respondents even associating declines in wisdom and generosity with increasing age (see also, Giles et al. 1998). 

Similarly, in a companion study examining Australian versus Japanese stu dents’ stereotypes, it was found that the former had more positive images than the latter (Ota, Giles, and Gallois 2002; see also, Arnhoff, Leon, and Lorge 1964; and Sharp, Price-Sharps, and Hanson 1998\) for similar findings with American-Japa nese and American-Thai comparisons, respectively). Looking at the other side of the intergenerational coin, Harwood and colleagues found that older age inform ants from Hong Kong and the People’s Republic of China (PRC) also endorsed nega tive stereotypes of their own age group; for them, wisdom and generosity declined with age (Harwood et al. 2001). 

**2.2 Workplace age stereotypes** 

The workplace represents one stirring context to examine intra- and intergenera tional communication within and across cultures. Workplace age stereotypes, de fined as the beliefs and expectations about a worker based on his or her age (Post huma and Campion 2009\) do not occur in isolation, and tend to reflect widespread societal stereotypes of people of different ages. In general, older and younger work ers are stereotypically perceived differentially, with older worker stereotypes often having negative overtones, while younger worker stereotypes tend to be compara tively more positive (e.g., young workers as physically and mentally more prepared to take on the demands of today’s workplace, etc.; for review, see Posthuma and Campion 2009).

Please add the closing paren thesis.   
Aging and communication across cultures **293** 

Minimal research has addressed the topic of age stereotypes in the workplace across cultures (Posthuma & Campion 2009). Addressing this research lacuna, McCann and Keaton (2013) compared young Thai and American workers percep tions of age stereotypes of older and same age younger workers. With few caveats, they found that both “negative” and “positive” age stereotypes were accentuated in the Thai sample. In other words, young Thai workers agreed more than their American counterparts with “negative” items that older workers make more mental mistakes, are slower to adapt to new technology, are more fearful of technology, and are less flexible at work, but they also agreed more with “positive” items that older workers are absent less, have a better attitude toward work, and have a high er level of commitment to the organization than younger workers. 

In interpreting their findings, the authors invoked the extremely fast pace of urbanization, industrialization, digitalization, and westernization in Thailand as a potentially exacerbating factor in the “generation gap” between older and younger workers. Because of changes in the workforce, technological developments, and so on, at some level young Thai workers may see older workers in an “enhanced age stereotypical light” – thus accentuating the more traditional positive older person stereotypes, but too seeing them as less prepared to cope with the changes of the new digitally connected world. 

**3 Communication and the changing role of the family and older person norms** 

**(including filial piety) across cultures** 

As was suggested in the previous section, culture can be regarded as a fundamen tal context of communication. Culture translates into an individuals’ cognition and affect which, in turn, may influence their communication patterns. The broad so cio/religio-philosophical tendencies of nations (e.g., collectivism, Confucianism) may form some basis for the emergence of cultural differences in intergenerational communication. Perhaps equally importantly, though, and central to the study of intergenerational relations, is the aforementioned notion of filial piety, a Confu cian-based doctrine that represents a natural backdrop and starting point for any meaningful discussion of cultural notions of intergenerational communication. 

Filial piety, as a concept, is known by different labels, and has been linked to various religions and philosophies (e.g., Buddhism, Taoism). It is also shared as a moral norm in a number of cultures, primarily across the East Asian Pacific Rim (e.g., Korea, China, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The closely related concept of “familism” (*familismo*) found in Central and South America is also central to intergenerational understanding, where multigeneration al households are more common than in North American and Europe (Kao 2005).  
**294** Robert M. McCann, Howard Giles and Hiroshi Ota 

According to the filial piety perspective, older adults are viewed positively and respected (e.g., as sources of wisdom), and offer various types of resources to peo ple in the younger generations, while young people, in return, observe their elders and provide care and support when needed. As we consider communication among the generations, one might, thus, predict – prior cross-cultural age stereotyping findings notwithstanding − that older people in Asian cultures would be viewed more positively, and that the communication climate between young and older adults would be one of young to old accommodation. However, research strongly suggests that this may not be the case, and that intergenerational interactions may be at least different, if not more problematic, in many Asian countries than in Western countries. It is important to keep in mind that, somewhat counterintuitive ly, the norms of filial piety, or respect for elders, could potentially have, because of its nature, adverse effects on intergenerational communication (Yeh 2003). 

One oft-cited study that supports this counterintuitive view investigated filial piety by comparing four Asian (Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and the Philippi nes) and four Western (Australia, New Zealand, the USA, and Canada) cultures (Gallois et al. 1999). Results showed that while East Asian students claimed they would indeed respect and look after older people (especially parents), this care was generally in terms of tangible instrumental support (e.g., financial, living ar rangements). If we consider the sheer magnitude of migrant workers across Asia and much of the world who support older members of their family (in the Philippi nes, for example, it is estimated that 15 % of workers are working abroad), there is no denying that filial piety is alive and well in the form of monetary support. 

This financial filial support is also characteristic of many quarters of Latin America. Recent research on the concept of *familismo* among Hispanic/Latino groups in the USA identified three dimensions of it: a) family obligations − or the norms to provide emotional or material/ financial support to one’s extended fami ly; b) family support − or helping relatives to solve their problems; and c) family as referents − or the perception of relatives as attitudinal or behavioral referents (Kao 2005). One core aspect of familism frequently takes the form of migration abroad and remittances sent home. Latin America has one of the largest remittance flows in the world, representing roughly 40 % of that sent to developing countries, exceeding both foreign investment and development aid in the region (Moctezuma Longoria 2003). 

Whereas financial support remains as a core aspect of filial piety, the young adult Asian respondents in the Gallois et al. (1999) study were particularly con cerned that they would not be able to match the elders’ expectations of contact and socio-emotional support. With increasing migration, jobs dispersed across the globe, the proliferation of nuclear households, and growing distances between old er relatives and children, the social aspects of filial piety, necessarily involving communication, may be more difficult to carry out for many young Asians. One interesting East-West contrast point that we can take away from this study is that  
Aging and communication across cultures **295** 

respondents from the four Western cultures felt less social pressure from older peo ple, and indicated more filial commitment to socially supporting, communicating with, and listening to their elders. 

The above studies represent but a small part of the mounting evidence that, with changes in family structure, migration, modernization, and Westernization, filial piety has eroded – or at least changed − in numerous urban quarters in Asia (e.g., Hong Kong, Manila, Tokyo, Seoul, and Bangkok). Implicit understandings of elder support − as elegantly summarized by the old Chinese phrase − “raise chil dren to ensure old age support” (*yang er fang lao*) may be changing, and even supplanted by government intervention. For example, more than 13 million fami lies in China have signed the FSAs State Council of the People’s Republic of China *jiating shanyang xieyi* (Family Support Agreement \[FSA\]), a voluntary contract be tween older parents and adult children on providing support to parents (see Chou 2010). Classical filial norms in China may no longer exist in a “pure” form in urban centers like Shanghai but, instead, may co-exist with other general social values that differ from Confucian scholarly ideals. Young adults in Hong Kong report that elders are still treasured for household contributions (e.g., helping with chores, taking care of grandchildren), and that they may play a role in ceremonial deci sions such as picking wedding dates (similar to what has been reported in Thai land). But these same elders are no longer regarded as the head of the household and are not entrusted to make financial decisions as they had done in the past. Japan is not an exception to this general trend (Tsutsui, Muramatsu & Higashino 2013). 

This shift in filial responsibility may, in part, explain why elder abuse, neglect, and disrespect for older people and their communication (at least for those who are not wealthy) are becoming more prevalent (see Lin & Giles 2013), and also why older person suicides are rising. One study reports suicide rates among those aged 75 or older in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and China as 4–8 times higher than among those aged 15–24 (Ruzicka 1998). The suicide rate in Japan among elderly people is the second highest in the world, and family conflict is reported as a fundamental cause of these suicides. In a 2008 *BBC News* (2008) article on suicide in Japan, the author notes that “as the traditional family structure has changed, some elderly people are worried that there will be no family members to care for them in their old age.” In addition to the negative future outlook, their sense of burden to the family may cause older adults to have suicidal ideation and actually choose to carry it out (Traphagan 2004). 

Examining more closely the concept of “respect” (which represents a core el ement of filial piety), while it still plays an important role in communication be tween younger and older adults, respect too seems to have undergone some degree of transformation. In a study conducted among older and middle aged respondents in Singapore, the meaning of “respect” was found to have shifted from obedience to courteous behavior (Mehta & Ko 2004), a finding echoed among similarly-aged  
**296** Robert M. McCann, Howard Giles and Hiroshi Ota 

respondents in the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand in other research (Ingersoll-Dayton & Saengtienchai 1999). Moreover, in a study by Ota, McCann, and Honeycutt (2012), young adults in Thailand − just like their counterparts in South Africa and Ghana in prior research (Giles, Makoni & Dailey 2005\) − found conversation with older adults more enjoyable and satisfying when conducted in a respectful manner. In other words, using polite language and adjusting conversa tion to please older adults, rather than obeying to older adults in communication, conveys a sense of respect to them, and holds an important key to successful con versation 

Still, communicative respect does not necessarily lead to satisfying intergener ational conversations and interactions. For example, in research by Ota et al. (2012), no significant relationship was found between respectful communication and conversational satisfaction among young Japanese adult respondents; similar results were found for young American adults (McCann et al. 2005\) and in South Africa and Ghana (Giles et al. 2005\) and Mongolia (Choi, Giles & Hajek 2012). Find ings such as these illustrate the complexity associated with the meaning of respect toward older adults in the contemporary world. Respect is a multifarious and multi dimensional construct, and as one core aspect of filial piety, we call for gerontologi cally-focused researchers to continue to examine the nuances and contexts of the meaning of respect in cultures around the globe. 

**4 Intra and intergenerational communication perceptions across cultures in general and in the workplace** 

The social psychology of intergroup relations has been used as a framework for many studies of communication between members of different age groups (Har wood et al. 1995; Hummert 2012), drawing as it has upon social identity theory (SIT: Tajfel & Turner 1986). According to SIT, an “ingroup positivity bias” forms the basis of people’s psychological and communicative approaches to members of other groups, and the strategies they may employ to change the relationship in volving the groups in contact. In this regard, communication accommodation theo ry (Giles in press; Soliz & Giles 2014\) expanded SIT into the domain of communica tion, positing that individuals adjust their verbal and nonverbal communication behaviors in ways that reflect their desire to belong to, or differentiate themselves from, various groups, and also as a means to facilitate or even impede interaction with relevant others (Coupland, Giles & Henwood 1988). Inappropriate accommo dation, such as under- or over-accommodation (or even reluctant accommodation) may result in negative consequences for communicators, such as lowered self-es teem and sense of coherence (Barker et al. 2004; Ryan et al. 1986).

**4.1 Research on younger adults’ communication with older adults in Eastern and Western cultures** 

From the above body of cross-research on stereotypes and filial piety, it is perhaps of no surprise that research over the past few decades suggests that young people’s perceptions of intergenerational communication may be more problematic in sev eral Asian cultures/countries than in Western countries. For instance, Williams et al. (1997) explored young people’s perceptions of their communicative interactions with older people who were not family members in four Western countries (the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) and in five East Asian countries (The Philippines, Hong Kong, People’s Republic of China \[PRC\], South Korea, and Ja pan), finding that communicating with older people may be a more positive experi ence in the West than in the East. 

More specifically, it was found that: older adults were viewed as less accommo dating; interactions with older people were viewed as largely dissatisfying; age “mattered more” in Eastern cultures than it did in the Western cultures (i.e., via respectful language); and perceptions of intergenerational communication experi ences were, in general, less favorable in the East than in the West*.* Importantly, there was some important variability within the Eastern cultures, particularly in the non-Confucian influenced, predominantly Catholic, Southeast Asian nation of The Philippines, whose young respondents reported positive intergenerational communication perceptions more in line with those in Western nations (see Ota, Giles & Somera 2007). Korean younger adults reported a high level of non-accom modation from older adults and also respect-obligation to them compared to the other Asian respondents. The importance of age in communication was under scored in another study by Lim and Giles (2007) where it was found that only a one year difference in the age of the interactant can make a significant difference in how younger adults communicate to one another. 

In three follow-up studies, researchers contrasted the views of Euro-Americans versus Taiwanese, Anglo-Australian versus Hong Kong, and Euro-Americans ver sus Japanese young respondents (Giles et al. 2002; Giles et al. 2003; Noels, Giles, Gallois & Ng 2001). This time, however, respondents were asked to evaluate their conversations with their same-aged peers as well. Lending support for the basic tenets of CAT and SIT, it was found that people of different adult generations often regard others and behave in ways that are biased in favor of one’s own age group along many dimensions and, again, the same intercultural pattern emerged. That is, the Eastern samples reported less favorable intergenerational experiences of communication, despite the fact that they felt more obligation to be respectful to older than younger people. Although there was some empirical variation across studies, young people found their elderly counterparts to be more non-accommo dating than their same-aged peers, and younger adults tended to close off or avoid intergenerational interaction – tendencies that were accentuated by Eastern re-  
**298** Robert M. McCann, Howard Giles and Hiroshi Ota 

spondents. This evaluative pattern, where ingroup and outgroups are communica tively differentiated, is often referred to as the “staircase pattern” (McCann et al. 2005). In the third of these three cross cultural studies (Giles et al. 2003), this pat tern held true even when *family* elders were also included into the evaluative frame. Although the conversations with these family elderly were more favorably construed than non-family “targets” (but less so, again, by Eastern than Western respondents), they were, nonetheless, regarded as more non-accommodating com pared to interactions with their peers. Interestingly, young adult Westerners (i.e., Australians, New Zealanders, and Americans) even reported more positive commu nication experiences with family elders than did young adult Korean, Filipino, and Japanese. 

**4.2 The Pacific Rim and beyond** 

Research on communication between different age groups was further conducted in many Pacific Rim countries, as well as in countries in other parts of the world, to explore the status of intergenerational communication more comprehensively. Findings of inter-Asian variability in communication emerged in many of these studies, particularly in Southeast Asia, a region of the Pacific Rim that differs from both the West and much of East Asia (e.g., Japan, China, Korea) in that its views on aging derive from different social and religio-philosophical traditions (e.g., Theravada Buddhism in Thailand). For example, McCann, Ota, Giles and Caraker (2003) investigated inter-Asian variability in intra- and intergenerational communi cation in the USA, Japan, and Thailand. When comparing perceptions of their own communication behaviors with that of young adults, conspicuous inter-Asian vari ability in responses emerged. While young Thai adults reported the highest levels of both respect/obligation and avoidant communication, what was especially fasci nating was that the Thais were also particularly respectful of same-age peers, as well as more avoidant in their communication of both young and old Thai adults. This was not the case for the Japanese. Similar results have emerged in other Thai land-based studies (McCann & Giles 2006, 2007), possibly due to the unique Thai cultural precept of “*kreng jai*” (deference and respect) that often occurs not only to those of superior status (e.g., due to age, rank), but also to those of equal or even inferior status as well. 

Later research continued to explore the Thai and Japanese cultural contexts, not only for the religio-cultural differences between the two countries, but also because of their significant economic relationship and major flows of tourism. One study compared Japanese and Thai younger adults’ intra- and intergenerational communication (Ota et al. 2012), with results revealing that both groups linearly, in a staircase fashion, increased communicative respect and avoidance, beliefs about politeness, and deference norms as interlocutors got older (from young to middle aged to older adult). Cross-culturally, the Thais again reported more respectful  
Aging and communication across cultures **299** 

communication to younger adults than did the Japanese, while the Japanese were more likely to be avoidant of communication with middle-aged adults. Both polite ness and deference norms were more strongly endorsed by the Thais than Japa nese, but the deference norm positively predicted respectful communication to middle-aged and older adults in Japan, and for young and middle-aged targets in Thailand. 

Within-country differences in communication have also emerged. For example, significant in-country (North Vietnam/South Vietnam) differences were found in reports of communication perceptions among young adults in Vietnam (McCann, Cargile, Giles & Bui 2004). When reflecting on their own communication behaviors, young American and North Vietnamese adults felt comparatively less need to be respectful in their communication to other people, in general, than did the South Vietnamese. The authors speculated that these findings may derive, in part, from confusion that young people in the North may feel over traditional ideals (e.g., veneration of older people) clashing with the realities that they presently face. 

Researchers examining younger adults’ communication with older adults later moved their work into India (Giles et al. 2007), Mongolia (Choi et al. 2013), Iran (Giles, Khajavy & Choi 2012), Ghana and South Africa (Giles et al. 2005), and Bul garia (Giles et al. 2010). Despite the geographically dispersed nature of these coun tries, a remarkable degree of cross-cultural consistency stands out in the findings from these studies. For example, younger adults communicatively differentiated members of their own age groups from others, with all studies confirming the pres ence of a clear “stair-case pattern” where older communication targets required greater respectful communication and induce greater avoidant communication. This staircase pattern also characterized younger people’s beliefs about respect and deference norms to different age group members, and stereotype perceptions to them. Finally, respect and deference norms, as well as perceived benevolence, were found to incrementally increase as the age of communication increased, while traits of personal vitality (e.g., attractive and strong) decreased. 

**4.3 Research with older respondents** 

Researchers have also investigated elderly people’s (e.g., 70–80 year olds’) views of their intra- and intergenerational communication experiences (Cai, Giles & Noels 1998; Keaton, McCann & Giles in press; Noels, Giles, Cai & Turay 1999; Ota et al. 2007). A number of compelling findings emerged from these studies. First, elderly people, too, have some negative intergenerational experiences to report, irrespec tive of their cultural origins. For them, the communication gap is reciprocally felt to the extent that both age groups perceived their own age peers were more accom modating to them than the other age group. Second, and somewhat surprisingly, a number of the elderly respondents reported communication problems with peo ple of their same (elderly) age group. More specifically, they found other older

people as more non-accommodating (talked as if they knew more than me, did not listen to what I had to say, were closed minded, etc.) than young people. Such non accommodation can sometimes be in the form of complaining and disclosure of painful information, such as “oh, my aches and pains,” and “my hip hurts.” This tendency was especially acute among Hong Kong, PRC, and Japanese informants. Put another way, for older people in these three Asian cultures, same-age group communication was actually as dissatisfactory as was intergenerational contact. As we will describe in greater detail later in this chapter, the managing of in-group relationships − especially non-accommodation from other older adults and one’s own reluctant and avoidant communication to their age peers – can play a key role in the maintenance of the psychological health of older adults. The fact that communication with younger adults may be comparatively “less problematic” than with same age (older peers) does not suggest that intergenerational communication takes place more often, or even helps an older person’s sense of positivity. 

**4.4 Communication at work** 

Cross cultural comparisons of communication between the generations in the workplace has begun to witness increasing attention (see McCann 2012; McCann & Giles 2002). Just as was the case in non-workplace settings, it has been found that young people communicatively favor their age-in-group over age-outgroups at work (McCann & Giles 2006, 2007; McCann & Keaton 2013). More importantly though, these studies extended findings to a “younger” older target (i.e., those aged 50 and above vs. 65 and above). Young workers thus show age in/out distinc tions at a far lower age than we have seen in most prior studies (see, however, Harwood & Giles 1993\)*.* Results such as those found above provide a strong piece of evidence that ageist discourse, expressed ageist attitudes, and discriminatory practices based on age are occurring even earlier in the lifespan than originally thought. Certain older worker stereotypes may too be relevant at earlier ages (i.e., 50 \+) than previously considered (McCann & Keaton 2013). 

Another interesting finding from the intergenerational workplace communica tion literature can be found in a study conducted at banks in the USA and Thai land. In this research, there were no age-by-nation (and rank-by-nation) interac tions found (McCann & Giles 2006). In other words, the Thai and American banker samples did not differ from each other regarding their views of young/ older bank ers. These novel results were in stark contrast to virtually every cross-cultural inter generational communication study conducted in non-organizational settings, lead ing McCann and Giles) to suggest that cultural work convergence could be an orga nizational dynamic which may help explain these findings. As the winds of cultural change whip through developing countries such as Thailand, their effects may be particularly salient in industries such as banking, where international transac tions, foreign customers, foreign consultants, direct capital investments, currency

fluctuations, and world trade patterns are a part of many Thai bankers’ daily lives at work. Environmental changes, and their subsequent impact on societal norms and values, could potentially hasten the blurring of certain cultural boundaries (e.g., certain ages) and create a scenario whereby Thailand and the United States, at least in the banking context, are somewhat alike in their “Westernization.” 

**5 Health implications of aging and communication (including cultural considerations)** 

Communication is tied to one’s well-being, how one perceives aging, and to some degree perhaps even how long one lives. In a groundbreaking study on longevity and positive self-perceptions of aging, Levy, Slade, and Kunkel (2002) found that older people who were exposed to negative images of aging, including words like “forgetful,” “feeble” and “shaky,” performed significantly worse on memory and balance tests. Additionally, this work revealed that older individuals with more positive self-perceptions of aging measured up to 23 years earlier and lived 7.5 years longer than those with less positive self-perceptions of aging. 

The communication predicament model (CPA) of aging illustrates the manner in which negative age stereotypes constrain older adults’ communicative behaviors in intergenerational interaction. According to the CPA (Ryan et al. 1986\) and other elaborations of the model (see Barker et al. 2004; Giles, Khajavy & Choi 2012), there are two possible routes towards psycho-social changes arising from intergenera tional communication. First, the process may proceed in a negative direction. Older adults may collude and act out unfavorable older adult stereotypes (Hummert 2010\) when receiving age-alerting messages, the consequences of which can lower elder esteem and even life satisfaction. Second, the negative spiral of aging may be impeded or counteracted, whereby positive change might be anticipated when older adults successfully defy younger adults’ stereotype-based communication, and/or the interaction is underpinned by shared beliefs regarding elder deference and respect (Levy & Langer 1994). For the latter case, young adults’ communicative accommodations (e.g., respectful language) may send favorable, supportive messa ges to older adults. In fact, Ryan et al. (1995) subsequently crafted a separate com municative enhancement of aging model to map out these pathways (see also, Giles, Khajavy & Choi 2012). Awareness of positive meanings may work to safe guard against the loss of psychological and physical health, while attention to norms of politeness and deference for intergenerational encounters may bring about greater communicative satisfaction for younger adults (McCann et al. 2005). 

Given this theoretical backdrop, the predictors (for young people) of satisfac tion when talking with older adults have been investigated. This work was original ly conducted in the USA (McCann et al. 2005), and was subsequently embraced  
**302** Robert M. McCann, Howard Giles and Hiroshi Ota 

(in studies cited above) in data from South Africa, Ghana, India, Bulgaria, Japan, Thailand, Iran and Mongolia (Mongolia and USA; Choi et al. 2013). While, for young adults, communicative avoidance has been a strong predictor of intergener ational dissatisfaction, and communicative respect, correspondingly, for satisfac tion, across virtually all cultural contexts studied to date, other predictors varied uniquely by location. Although the origins of this variation remain interpretively elusive, all this suggests that culture, an enormously broad and contested concept, can be a critical component as to what constitutes intergenerational satisfaction. 

Research guided by the CPA led some researchers to suggest that it fares better in Western than Eastern countries. For instance, when referring to findings from their own and prior studies, Noels et al. (1999) state that “these findings suggest that the CPA model may be culturally specific to the North American context, and future research might well attempt to delineate the cultural contexts in which this model applies” (p. 132; see also Barker et al. 2004). Other research has begun to question this argument (e.g., Filipino data provided the best fit for the CPA in work by Ota et al. 2007; Thai and American data also provided fit; Keaton et al. in press). 

**6 Conclusion** 

Many studies conjointly suggest elder denigration is more pronounced in Eastern than Western cultures. Rapid population aging and societal industrialization joined by the erosion of cultural traditions (e.g., collectivism, filial piety) may hold countable for such results as North and Fiske (in press) indicate. Long-term re search involving many more cultures including Latin America is indeed important to determine how various dimensions of social change, including globalization, are reflected in age stereotypes, norms of filial piety, perceived vitality of different age groups, and in turn, communication. 

The workplace is one highly important context that needs further investigation. Older workers often find themselves in a paradoxical position where they are at once discriminated against and also needed as a valuable resource and transmitter of culture. Inviting older adults into the workplace has a theoretical and practical importance and Bowen and Skirbekk (2013) suggested that older people are per ceived as more competent in countries where they actively engage in paid work or volunteer activities (see Gasiorek and Giles 2013). Further, continuing to work may lead to identification of *ikigai* in Japanese, or “something to live for, to experienc ing the joy of goals and a life worth living” (Ryff et al. 2015: 668). People, regardless of age, need *ikigai* to live a healthy life. Creating work and giving proper roles to older adults there should help them find *ikigai* and thereby boost their sense of worth. 

Managing the effects of demographic changes and industrialization requires a large scale concerted effort, involving government and community. What each of

us can do is to pay attention to our communication practices (Giles et al. 2013). Talking about aging and care in older age play important roles in the way they prepare for the future and maintain their health (Gasiorek, Fowler and Giles in press). Communication accommodation, listening, and understanding the mean ings implied in the used communication strategies (e.g., jokes) and “competent” (effective and appropriate) use of verbal and nonverbal communication will be a step toward building mutually respectful relationships, desired particularly in so called Eastern cultures.

**Abstract** 

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) represents a critical point for controlling cognitive decline.   NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
Patterns of communication difficulty have been observed in patients with MCI and warrant  

examination and management. The present systematic review examined (1) characteristics of  

communication difficulty in MCI by focusing on two domains: expressive and receptive  

communication, and (2) cognitive interventions that addressed communication difficulties in  

individuals with MCI. Of the 28 observational studies we reviewed, expressive and receptive  

communications were generally impaired in individuals with MCI, compared to their healthy  

counterparts. However, only one of seven interventions effectively improved communication  

related outcomes. We finished the paper with a discussion about how neuroplasticity influences  communication abilities in individuals with MCI to inform the future development of  

interventions for communication difficulty.

**Introduction** 

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a heterogeneous disorder of older adults characterized by  

mild cognitive decline, is often a prodromal phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other  

dementias.1 Clinically, individuals with MCI may complain of subjective cognitive  

concerns, and will demonstrate objective evidence of cognitive impairment (1–1.5 SD below  

the mean for age- and education-matched peers) that cannot be accounted for by normal  

aging processes. They do not yet exhibit impairment in their ability to perform basic  

activities of daily living (BADLs), while instrumental ADLs may or may not be  

impaired.1, 2 There are four clinical subtypes of MCI. In amnestic MCI (aMCI), the  

individual experiences memory impairment; in nonamnestic MCI (naMCI), memory is

unimpaired, but deficits are seen in other cognitive domains such as executive functions,  

visual-spatial skills and/or language.3 Each of these subtypes is then further divided into    
NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
single or multiple domain categories, depending on whether one or more cognitive skills are    
affected.1 

MCI represents a critical point for controlling cognitive decline, and an important target for  

secondary prevention techniques aimed at slowing further progression to dementia.4, 5 Of  

note, most available interventions in MCI have targeted memory.4, 6 However, patterns of  

communication difficulty have also been observed in patients with MCI and warrant  

examination and, potentially, management. Communication difficulty refers to deficits in  

receiving, sending, processing, or comprehending verbal, nonverbal or graphic messages-,  

and is an important domain for everyday functioning.7 In one study of heart failure patients,  

communication impairments were found to significantly predict adherence to treatment  

guidelines.8 Additionally, in a study of over 12,000 Medicare beneficiaries, those with  

communication impairments were found to be significantly more dissatisfied with the health  

care they received than those without such impairments.9 From these studies, one can infer  

that communication difficulty may serve a similar role in predicting health care quality and  

satisfaction in MCI, although research specific to MCI in this regard is limited.   
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
Relatively brief clinical visits to medical providers require patients to efficiently organize,  

articulate and understand complex medical discussions and choices in order to make  

treatment decisions that adequately reflect their care goals and values. While still usually  

deemed capable of making such decisions, patients with MCI have been shown to score  

significantly lower on measures of “understanding, appreciation, and reasoning” as  

compared to cognitively normal peers.10 For example, a study examined older adults’  

response to information about fictitious medications, and found that those with MCI were  

more responsive to the way the information was framed than were their healthy  

counterparts. Specifically, when positive information was conveyed using positive wording,  

or negative information with negative wording, those with MCI judged the sham  

medications similarly to healthy counterparts. However, when positive information was  

framed using negative wording, or negative information with positive wording, adults with  

MCI were more influenced by the way the information was framed than were the healthy  

elders, responding more to the tone of the message than the information itself.11 This    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
suggests that how information is expressed when delivering it to cognitively impaired adults  

is critically important and may influence their health care decisions. Therefore, for health  

care providers, understanding the communication profiles of people with MCI can help  

ensure that they receive comprehensible diagnostic information, fully understand their  

medical care options, and make well-considered treatment decisions, according to their  

personal goals of care. 

To our knowledge, there has been only a single topic that included communication deficits  

in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.12 The present systematic review focused  

exclusively on studies of participants with MCI, identified using standard diagnostic  

criteria,1 excluding studies of subjects with dementia (unless included as a comparison  

group to MCI participants). Communication relies on multiple dimensions of cognitive  

abilities, including executive function (verbal fluency), memory (semantic memory), as well

as language. Communication difficulties described in this review were classified into  

expressive and receptive domains.7 Expressive communication refers to the output of    
NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
communicative messages, or the use or production of language, and includes verbal fluency  

(semantic fluency and phonemic fluency), semantic memory (especially word retrieval and  

access to semantic knowledge), and expressive discourse. Studies examining motor speech  

production (strength, speed, control and agility of the speech mechanisms including the lips,  

tongue, larynx, etc.) were also included with the expressive communication studies, due to  

their focus on communication output. Receptive communication refers to understanding of  

messages, and encompasses sentence comprehension, receptive discourse, and reading  

comprehension. We also reviewed cognitive interventions that targeted outcomes related to  

communication deficits. Of note, almost all such interventions are cognition driven. We are  

aware of one study targeting communication deficits using physical exercise as the  

intervention,13 which was not included in this review, but was described in the discussion.  

We finished this paper with a discussion about how neuroplasticity influences  

communication abilities in patients with MCI and by making recommendations for future  

research directions in this area.

**Methods** 

**Literature Review** 

For this systematic review, the literature search was filtered by age (65 years or older) and  

by English language. Studies examining samples that were not specifically identified as  

having any subtypes of MCI based on Peterson’s criteria (2009) described above were  

excluded. Reference lists of relevant studies provided additional sources for this review.  

Studies with publication dates prior to 1999 were excluded as the MCI criteria were not yet  

fully validated.14 Two searches were conducted in PubMed. The first search was conducted  

for observational studies, using terms “mild cognitive impairment” in combination with  

“communication disorders” (109 citations), “aphasia” (37 citations) or “discourse” (2  

citations). The second search was conducted for cognitive intervention studies that targeted  

communication outcomes, using the terms “mild cognitive impairment”, “Alzheimer’s  

disease”, “cognitive therapy”, “cognitive intervention”, “cognitive training”, and  

“communication”. Various combinations of these terms yielded 160 articles. Two  

researchers (M. J. and F. L.) independently examined the relevant papers. Information about    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
the study design and findings related to communication difficulties are presented in Table 1  

(observational studies) and Table 2 (intervention studies). 

**Results** 

**Observational studies** 

A total of 29 observational (25 cross-sectional and 4 longitudinal) studies described the  

communication difficulties in MCI (see Table 1). 

**Expressive communication impairments** 

**Verbal fluency—**Verbal fluency tasks can be subdivided into three types: semantic  

fluency (generating items in a category), phonemic fluency (generating items beginning with  

Top Geriatr Rehabil. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 October 27\.   
Johnson and Lin Page 4 

a specific letter), and verb fluency (generating as many verbs as possible).15 Verbal fluency  

tasks are generally measured as the number of items elicited within a time limit (e.g., one    
NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
minute). Sixteen cross-sectional studies consistently found that individuals with MCI had  

significantly worse performance in verbal fluency compared to their healthy  

counterparts.11, 16–28 Specifically, the patterns of verbal fluency deficits in individuals with  

MCI included production of fewer subcategories, and fewer items within those categories,  

compared to healthy counterparts.24 Six studies demonstrated better verbal fluency    
performance by those with MCI than those with AD. 23, 25, 27–30 

Several factors influenced the verbal fluency performance in MCI, including the specific  

category or letter being assessed, the subtype of MCI, and level of education. In one study,  

subjects with MCI were able to name more animals than words beginning with the letter  

“F”, but fewer vegetables than words beginning with the letter “S”.17 By combining results  

across three phonemic and two semantic fluency tasks, Brandt and Manning (2009) found  

that participants with single-domain aMCI performed similarly to healthy counterparts, with  

no discrepancy between semantic and phonemic tasks, while participants with multiple 

domain MCI performed similar to those with AD, with more difficulty with the semantic  

fluency than phonemic fluency tasks. In addition, level of education affected scores on    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
semantic fluency tasks more than on lexical fluency in Japanese subjects with MCI.30 

Only one longitudinal study examined verbal fluency.31. The researchers assessed verbal  

fluency annually in individuals with MCI and found they were impaired relative to healthy  

counterparts on semantic fluency tasks from baseline throughout the ten year study period.    
In contrast, phonemic fluency was intact at baseline, but became impaired at year six.31 

**Semantic memory—**Semantic memory refers to general knowledge, including factual  

information, the meanings of words and general information,32 and is often measured by  

tests of word retrieval or naming of objects, but also includes tests of naming of proper  

nouns, , synonyms, word associations, similarities, and definition-word matching, among  

others. A total of 17 cross-sectional studies examined semantic memory in individuals with  

MCI, 12 of which found impairments relative to healthy  

counterparts. 11, 16, 18, 19, 27, 28, 33–39 However, three studies found no difference between    
participants with MCI and healthy counterparts on semantic memory tasks.25, 26, 31, 40, 41    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
Seven studies showed significantly better performance for participants with MCI than for  

those with AD, 11, 16, 18, 25, 27, 28, 34 while two demonstrated no difference between MCI and    
AD groups on semantic memory.19, 37 

The specific task demands of the measures influenced the performance on semantic memory  

tests in individuals with MCI. Participants with aMCI scored comparably to healthy  

counterparts on the Boston Naming Test, although when spontaneous naming was examined  

(i.e., no semantic or phonemic cues provided), the participants with aMCI scored lower than  

the healthy counterparts, but superior to those with mild AD.16 Additionally, on a three part  

assessment of semantic memory including naming famous buildings, celebrity faces, and  

objects, participants with MCI named significantly fewer items on each test than the healthy  

counterparts. Further, 13% of the healthy counterparts were impaired on all tests, whereas  

87% of subjects with MCI were impaired on at least one of the tests. Both groups of  

Top Geriatr Rehabil. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 October 27\.   
Johnson and Lin Page 5 

participants named fewer proper nouns (faces and buildings) than objects. The combination  

of the three tasks correctly predicted group membership 78.1% of the time for those with    
NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
MCI and 100% of the time for the healthy counterparts.42 Finally, intentional access to  

semantic memory (word retrieval) was found to be impaired in adults with MCI relative to  

the healthy counterparts, but automatic access (e.g., deciding whether items were words or  

non-words) remained intact; both intentional and automatic access were impaired in    
participants with AD, compared to those with MCI.34 

Three longitudinal studies examined semantic memory over time in individuals with  

MCI.31, 38, 39 In two of them, semantic memory was significant predictor of progression  

from MCI to AD.38, 39 The third study did not find any significant difference between the  

participants with MCI and the healthy counterparts in semantic memory, on measures of    
word retrieval or semantic associations.31 

**Expressive discourse—**A total of seven cross-sectional studies examined expressive  

discourse. Discourse, also called connected language, can be thought of as a, “window into  

the flow or misflow of information that may occur … as the speaker translates his or her  

thoughts into language”.43 Measurements of expressive discourse in this review included    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
picture description,18 verbal descriptions of an imaginary trip,36, 40 and story recall and  

inferencing.28, 43–45 Of note, although story recall is often conceptualized as a measure of  

episodic memory ability, it was considered as a measure of discourse in this review, as story  

recall and inferencing appear to mirror the cognitive demands of daily discourse, including  

conversation, and are influenced by a person’s language abilities.28 In addition, expressive  

discourse measures also encompass receptive discourse demands. That is, in order for a  

story to be accurately recalled and retold, it must have first been comprehended, synthesized  

and integrated by the participant. (See receptive discourse, below). 

Expressive discourse ability was found to be impaired in individuals with MCI when  

compared to healthy counterparts in six studies, 28, 36, 40, 43, 45, 46 while one study found no  

difference between the two groups.18 Four studies found that subjects with MCI performed    
better on story recall tasks than did those with AD.18, 28, 43, 45 

In the only longitudinal study examining expressive discourse, Fleming and Harris found  

that there was no significant decline in expressive discourse skills between baseline and six    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
months in eight participants with MCI.35 

**Motor Speech—**Motor speech production skills were examined in two cross-sectional  

studies, measured by diadochokinetic (DDK) rate, a test of articulatory agility measured by  

rapid, successive repetitions of the syllables “pa ta ka”,47 and by speed of sentence  

repetitions and vocal loudness.29 Both studies found that motor speech remained largely  

unaffected in adults with MCI when compared to their healthy counterparts, and individuals    
with MCI performed significantly better than those with AD.29, 47 

**Receptive communication impairments** have been less thoroughly studied than the  

expressive areas described above. Nevertheless, patterns of deficit have been found in  

subjects with MCI. 

Top Geriatr Rehabil. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 October 27\.   
Johnson and Lin Page 6 

**Sentence comprehension—**Sentence comprehension refers to the understanding of  

single statements, and was assessed in only one longitudinal study, using the Token Test,    
NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
Subtest V, a measure of comprehension of commands of increasing complexity. Their  

results showed that, of the 23% of the original sample who developed dementia after two    
years, 40% showed initial impairments on the Token Test.39 

**Receptive discourse—**Receptive discourse refers to one’s ability to comprehend  

connected narrative productions. As described above, this domain is difficult to fully  

separate from expressive discourse, as most tasks measuring discourse include both  

receptive and expressive components. In this review, two cross-sectional studies measured  

receptive discourse by eliciting recall and recognition of both gist and detail information  

from a narrative text.28, 43 Adults with MCI showed poorer ability to recall and recognize  

details from a narrative story than did their healthy counterparts, but performed better than  

the subjects with AD on these tasks. 

**Reading comprehension—**Three cross-sectional studies examined reading  

comprehension, which refers to the understanding of written narratives.11, 44, 45 In one  

study, the subjects completed a reading comprehension test, and there were no significant    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
differences between those with MCI, those with AD, and the healthy counterparts.11 In the  

other two studies, subjects were required to read a text and then to verbally state the details  

and gist of the passage. In order to successfully accomplish this task, subjects needed to be  

able to understand what they had read.44, 45 In both studies, subjects with MCI performed  

poorer on this task than the healthy counterparts did. In the study by Hudon and colleagues,  

participants with AD were also included, and performed significantly worse than those with    
MCI. 45 

**Cognitive interventions with communication outcomes** 

Limited intervention studies have been conducted on communication outcomes in  

individuals with MCI. Seven cognitive intervention studies were identified (see Table  

2).48–54 Three studies utilized weekly small group sessions ranging from 90–120 minutes;  

the remaining four employed individual computerized cognitive training (CCT) sessions for  

13–100 minutes per day, 4–5 days per week. Intervention durations ranged from three weeks  

to one year. Cognitive interventions were generally categorized into: memory, attention,    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
processing speed, executive function-focused or multi-modal interventions.55 Two studies  

were memory interventions. One study of 25 subjects with MCI and 17 healthy counterparts  

focused on memory strategy training,56 and did not demonstrate improvement on story  

recall, a measure of receptive and expressive discourse, in either group. The other study  

targeted memory through education regarding memory, relaxation training, memory skills  

training and psychoeduction on structuring memory-related beliefs, but the intervention  

group (9 subjects with MCI) did not improve their receptive and expressive discourse (story    
recall) compared to the control group (10 subjects with MCI).51 

Auditory processing speed and accuracy was targeted utilizing CCT in one study; no  

significant differences were found between treatment (22 subjects with MCI) and control  

Top Geriatr Rehabil. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 October 27\.   
Johnson and Lin Page 7 

(25 subjects without MCI) groups on measures of semantic memory and verbal fluency at    
post-intervention.48   
NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
The remaining four intervention studies applied multi-modal approaches, simultaneously  

targeting multiple cognitive domains.50, 52–54 Wenisch et al. targeted memory, executive  

function, and visuospatial skills by teaching cognitive strategies, and demonstrated no  

significant change in the measure of verbal fluency in either the 12 subjects with MCI or the  

12 healthy counterparts following the intervention.54 Cipriani et al. utilized CCT for  

attention, memory, perception, visuospatial cognition, and language skills training, but did  

not elicit improvement on verbal fluency tasks in 10 subjects with MCI, although the 10  

with AD did improve on the phonemic fluency task.50 Talassi and colleagues combined  

CCT with occupational therapy and behavioral training (targeting “mood symptoms”, p.  

392), and found no statistically significant difference in the intervention groups (30 with  

MCI, 24 with mild dementia) on verbal fluency or discourse (story recall), as compared to  

the active control groups (7 with MCI, 5 with mild dementia).53 Rozzini and colleagues  

examined the effects on subjects with MCI of CCT (addressing attention, memory, abstract  

reasoning, visuospatial skills and language) alone (n=22), as well as in combination with  

cholinesterase inhibitors (n=15), to a no treatment control group (n=22), and demonstrated    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
significant improvement for the group receiving the combined intervention on story recall  

(receptive and expressive discourse), but not on verbal fluency measures. The CCT-only  

group and the control group did not show any significant improvements on either language    
measure.52 

**Discussion** 

The purpose of this systematic review was to examine observational and intervention studies  

addressing the communication characteristics of older adults with MCI by dividing the  

communication into expressive and receptive domains. Before further discussing any results,  

some limitations should be acknowledged. First, this systematic review was limited to a  

PubMed search only. Other databases that may contain studies related to communication  

difficulties (e.g., PsychInfo) were not reviewed. Second, communication is an everyday skill  

highly relying on multiple cognitive abilities, especially language, executive function, and  

semantic memory, and many of these cognitive abilities are highly interrelated, thus, some    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
of the distinctions made here on the categories of communication may be somewhat  

artificial and incomplete.28, 43 Third, communication difficulties in the clinical application  

may include psychosocial aspects. Communication is the “process of creating shared  

meaning” between a sender and a receiver, and includes all of their thoughts, perspectives,  

ideas, history and biases.57 Examination of these psychosocial and interpersonal aspects of  

communication in older adults with MCI was beyond the scope of this review, but would be  

useful to incorporate into future studies, especially when designing interventions to address  

communication challenges in MCI. 

**Observational Studies** 

The first purpose of the study was to characterize the communication deficits of MCI in  

observational studies. First, motor speech production, representing a fundamental aspect of  

Top Geriatr Rehabil. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 October 27\.   
Johnson and Lin Page 8 

communication (i.e., the ability to produce the motor movements necessary to formulate  

intelligible speech) was largely unaffected in elders with MCI. Regarding higher-order    
NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
cognitive domains that are related to communication, in general, individuals with MCI  

perform worse than their healthy counterparts, but better than those with AD in expressive  

communication within the domains of verbal fluency, semantic memory, and expressive  

discourse. However, there are several exceptions that warrant further exploration. First,  

individuals with MCI may perform differently even within the same communication  

domain, depending on the format of the measures. For example, although semantic and  

phonemic fluency tasks both test verbal fluency, individuals with MCI performed better on  

the former.17 Similarly, although nine of the studies in this review utilized the Boston  

Naming Test to examine semantic memory, differences in performance were found when  

alternate tasks were used. In one study, adults with MCI were able to name common objects  

more easily than famous buildings and famous faces, suggesting that naming of proper  

nouns may have somewhat different neural underpinnings than naming of objects.33 Second,  

individuals with multiple-domain MCI may have more impairment than those with single 

domain MCI in expressive communication, at least in the domain of verbal fluency.17 This  

finding adds support to the notion that communication is an everyday function relying on    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
multiple cognitive abilities. Thus, individuals with multiple cognitive deficits, as seen in  

multiple-domain MCI, may experience greater communicative impairments. Third, although  

education is assumed to be one of the most consistent factor influencing cognitive abilities,  

its influence on the different communication domains and measures varies. For example,  

level of education was found to influence performance on semantic fluency, but not on    
phonemic fluency tasks.30 

Of note, discourse may be a particularly rich area for differentiating the different levels of  

communication functioning between individuals with MCI and those with dementia or those  

without cognitive impairment. Discourse can be measured in a variety of ways and entails a  

complex interweaving of receptive and expressive language skills, as well as executive  

function, required for such tasks as planning narrative productions and generating  

inferences, among others.43 Discourse is integral to human interaction, such as between  

medical providers and patients, thus, discourse may be a vital mechanism in understanding  

how communication difficulties impact the quality of medical care by examining MCI  

patients’ interactions with health care providers.   
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
Receptive communication characteristics of older adults with MCI have been less  

thoroughly described, although a few studies demonstrated impairments in individuals with  

MCI compared to their healthy counterparts in the areas of sentence comprehension,  

receptive discourse and reading comprehension. More studies, especially prospectively  

examining the degenerative process from normal aging, to MCI, to AD, are needed to lead  

to strong conclusions as to the distinguishing features of receptive communication in MCI. 

Of note, the studies describe within this review do not represent all communication domains.  

For instance, no studies examined written communication in elders with MCI. Written  

description tasks of complex pictures were found to differentiate cognitively normal adults    
from those with probable AD.58

Johnson and Lin Page 9 

**Cognitive Intervention Studies** 

The second purpose of this review was to examine cognitive intervention studies with    
NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
communication outcomes. As mentioned above, communication skills are interdependent on  

various domains of cognitive function, and all of the intervention studies reviewed here  

addressed communication by targeting different cognitive domains. Despite all that is  

known about communication impairments in MCI, and the current high degree of interest in    
cognitive training as a potential means for slowing cognitive decline in aging and MCI,6, 55  

only seven cognitive intervention studies were identified that included communication  

outcomes in the areas of verbal fluency, semantic memory, and expressive and receptive  

discourse. Of these studies, utilizing a variety of approaches, only one, incorporating a  

combination of cognitive training and pharmacological treatment, resulted in improvement    
in receptive and expressive discourse (story recall) in MCI participants.52 

In addition to the small sample sizes (n=12 to 59 MCI participants), a major reason that may  

explain the lack of treatment effect in most of the reviewed intervention studies is that most  

of the interventions did not target domains of communication directly, or the transferring  

effect from the primarily targeted cognitive domain to communication related domains are    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
not strong enough. The latter point is discussed below in the “neuroplasticity” section.  

Rozzini et al. was the only study that achieved a significant intervention effect in the MCI  

participants, and the only study directly targeting communication by including a language  

component within their computerized cognitive training intervention.52 There have been  

studies conducted with other types of participants that are illustrative for future interventions  

in MCI. In one, expressive discourse measures were found to decline more slowly in  

patients with mild-moderate AD who received both pharmacological and eight weekly  

multi-modal communication treatment sessions comprised of education, communication  

strategies, and assistance in developing a “Life Stories Book”.59 Additionally, in a study in  

which subjects received “lexical-semantic training” exercises in group setting twice per  

week for three months, improvements were seen in all communication measures (phonemic  

and semantic fluency, semantic memory, story recall) in participants with early stage  

probable AD, as compared to healthy counterparts.60 These studies point to the potential for  

improvement in communication skills when they are specifically targeted in the intervention  

design. 

 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
Although only cognitive intervention studies were included in this review, there may be  

other types of behavioral interventions that may be beneficial for managing communication  

difficulties in MCI. One randomized controlled trial was located that utilized physical  

exercise (walking and hand and face exercises) and resulted in improvements in a measure  

of semantic fluency in participants with MCI.13 Furthermore, in a quasi-experimental study  

examining the effects of a four year program that included volunteer work or other  

community activities, physical exercise, verbal fluency, and conversational stimulation  

treatment, four subjects with mild-moderate AD maintained or improved on a number of  

expressive discourse measures.61 Other types of behavioral interventions, e.g., physical  

exercise, or a combination of different types of behavioral interventions warrant further  

exploration in individuals with MCI.

**Neuroplasticity** 

It is important to note that the observable, behavioral aspects of communication difficulties    
NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
in MCI may be closely related to the structural and functional changes that are occurring  

within the brain. For example, one study demonstrated that both MCI and early AD  

participants were impaired in semantic memory, and both groups had cortical atrophy of the  

anterior temporal lobe and inferior prefrontal cortex.37 In another study of a group of  

patients from very mild cognitive impairment to AD, the researchers found that impaired  

verb fluency was predicted by temporal lobe hypoperfusion (as assessed using single-photon  

emission computed tomography), while noun fluency was predicted by parietotemporal 

occipital hypoperfusion.62 In addition, de Zubicaray and colleagues demonstrated that a  

network including the left anterior temporal lobe, posterior temporal lobes, posterior inferior  

parietal lobes as well as two frontal lobe connective pathways were critical for semantic  

memory function in healthy older adults.63 Thus, although the brain structure and function  

underlying the communication difficulties in MCI have not been fully explored, it is  

possible to surmise that they are influenced by a broad frontal-temporal-parietal network.    
Importantly, these brain regions are affected earliest in the neurodegenerative process.64 

 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
In applying behavioral interventions to improve communication functioning in patients with  

MCI, it is important to consider the potential mechanisms by which behavioral interventions  

may influence the development of neuroplastic alterations (i.e., changes of brain properties)  

that are related to the communication deficits. Neuroplastic changes occur within the brain  

as a result of interactions with the environment.65 Accumulated studies with a focus on  

executive function have demonstrated that different types of behavioral interventions,  

especially cognitive training, induce measurable changes in structure and function (e.g.,  

cerebral blood flow, glucose metabolism rate) of the brain regions that are closely related to  

targeted executive function in patients with MCI.66, 67 It is unclear whether communication  

oriented behavioral interventions would induce similar neuroplastic changes. 

Park and Reuter-Lorenz’s Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition (STAC) may provide  

a theoretical framework for further understanding neuroplasticity and communication  

functioning in patients with MCI.68 STAC proposes that compensatory scaffolding helps  

maintain high functioning behavior/cognition in the aging process. Compensatory  

scaffolding refers to the recruitment of additional neural circuitry to offset the brain    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
structural and functional changes due to normal aging. The frontal lobe, especially the  

prefrontal cortex, plays an important role in the process of compensatory scaffolding.  

Communication skills are utilized continuously throughout the lifespan, therefore likely  

resulting in a robust and durable neural network.68 However, as people age, these original  

networks, especially in the frontal-temporal-parietal region, break down, which results in the  

need for compensatory scaffolding mechanisms. For example, in one study, performance on  

a semantic memory test was compared between younger and older groups.69 Using fMRI,  

the authors found increased activation of the inferior frontal cortex in the older group, even  

during the test with low difficulty level, as compared to the younger adults. Similarly,  

Meinzer and colleagues also observed increased activation of inferior frontal cortex across  

different difficulty levels of verbal fluency tasks in an older group, as compared to a    
younger group.70 

Top Geriatr Rehabil. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 October 27\.   
Johnson and Lin Page 11 

During the neurodegenerative process, as seen in MCI, the neural pathology (e.g., beta 

amyloid accumulation in the frontal lobe) disrupts the protective function of the    
NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
compensatory scaffolding. As hypothesized, cognitive training may provide a way to  

enhance or prevent the disruption of the compensatory scaffolding of the brain due to such  

pathological changes, especially during the early stage of decline, as seen in MCI. However,  

the current task is to find the most appropriate training program that can help with the  

scaffolding to compensate for the communication impairments seen in MCI. In a newly  

published study, healthy older adults demonstrated direct improvement in working memory,  

which is primarily controlled by the prefrontal cortex, following training of working  

memory. This training also effectively improved the untargeted communication-related  

domains of auditory and reading comprehension.71 While not conducted with cognitively  

impaired adults, this study is supportive of the notion that cognitive training directly  

targeting prefrontal cortex may most effectively and directly enhance compensatory  

scaffolding, and ultimately, may affect other untargeted brain regions that are related to  

communication domains. As mentioned before, most of the intervention studies we reviewed  

did not directly target communication domains, but they did not target cognitive functions  

that are directly related to prefrontal cortex either. This may help explain why those studies    
 NIH-PA Author Manuscript  
failed to find any significant transfer effect from trained cognitive domains to untrained  

communication domains. Nevertheless, STAC may provide an entirely new pathway for  

developing cognitive interventions that may effectively address communication difficulties  

in individuals with MCI, through a potential transferring effect from the enhancement of the  

prefrontal cortex, where the compensatory scaffolding occurs, to the communication-related  

domains. 

**Conclusions** 

In summary, communication difficulty is an important component of the MCI profile that  

differentiates individuals with MCI from cognitively healthy elderly and patients with AD,  

and may therefore be a key target for intervention efforts designed to improve multiple  

domains of well-being in individuals with MCI.

**Principal Findings**   
Phonemic fluency: MCI=NCI\>AD; semantic fluency:    
AD\<MCI\<NCI. MCI not statistically different from NCI on    
any other measures of semantic memory, better than AD on    
picture naming, word-picture matching, word synonyms,    
Pyramids and Palm Trees test.   
MCI\<NCI on all tasks. In both groups, scores on    
GNT\>GBT\>GNT. 31% of MCI participants impaired on 1    
test, 28% impaired on 2, 28% impaired on all 3, 13%    
impaired on none; 13% of controls impaired on 1 test, 87%    
impaired on none. Combination of all 3 tasks correctly    
predicted 78.1% of MCI participants, 100% of controls.   
Semantic memory, verbal fluency, immediate and delayed    
story recall tests: AD\<MCI\<NCI. Story recognition task:    
AD\<MCI=NCI. Sensitivity and specificity of story recall for    
identifying MCI and AD was low in participants with ≤6    
years of education, but acceptable in those with ≥7 years.   
BNT total score (with cues): AD\<aMCI=controls. BNT    
spontaneous naming (without cues): AD\<aMCI\<controls.    
Verbal fluency scores: AD\<aMCI\<controls.   
aMCI-sd showed no difference between semantic and    
phonemic fluency, similar to NCI. aMCI-md had poorer    
semantic than phonemic fluency, similar to AD.   
All groups produced similar numbers of words on picture    
description (expressive discourse); task did not differentiate    
between MCI and mild AD or MCI and NCI. Semantic    
memory and verbal fluency: AD\<MCI\<NCI.   
Phonemic and semantic fluency: AD\<MCI\<NCI. Semantic    
memory: AD=MCI\<NCI. Less challenging language section    
of ACE-R showed AD\<NCI; did not discriminate MCI.   
Production of accurate inferences from the story:    
AD=MCI\<NCI. Main idea and lesson from the story, and    
statement of important information: AD\<MCI\<NCI.   
Naming faces, definition-word matching, semantic fluency:    
MCI\<NCI. Naming faces and objects, semantic fluency and    
definition-word matching: AD\<MCI. Naming faces,    
definition-word matching and semantic fluency were good    
predictors of SCI vs. MCI vs. AD.

**Principal Findings**   
MCI group impaired relative to NCI on picture naming and    
semantic probes, but not lexical decision; AD group    
impaired on all relative to MCI. MCI group impaired on    
Stroop picture naming but not Stroop.   
AD\<a-MCI\<NCI.   
AD\<MCI\<NCI. MCI and NCI performed better on semantic    
fluency than phonemic.   
MCI performed similarly to NCI on BNT. MCI scored    
poorer, compared to NCI, on discourse length and quality,    
but not syntactic complexity.   
After 15 seconds, MCI performed significantly better than    
AD or VD; After 30 seconds, MCI performed significantly    
poorer than NCI.   
MCI provided less thematic information than all other    
groups. MCI and PWND provided more irrelevant    
comments and were more verbose than NCI groups.    
Semantic memory: MCI=PWND\<NCI.   
Detail and gist measures: AD\<MCI\<NCI.   
Naming objects and faces, and on semantic knowledge    
(answering questions about named objects and faces):    
AD=MCI\<NCI..   
MCI produced more words than AD. Level of education

phonemic fluency in MCI and AD participants   
AD\<a-MCI\<NCI. aMCI and early AD patients show a    
greater discrepancy between semantic and phonemic fluency    
than controls (semantic scores\<phonemic scores).   
MCI produced more words with faster reaction times than    
AD on verbal fluency tasks; not significantly different from    
NCI. No statistically significant difference on DDK rate in    
MCI as compared to early AD (mod-severe AD were    
slower). MCI had faster sentence repetition than those with    
mod AD; not statistically different from NCI. MCI produced    
more intense (louder) speech than AD; not statistically    
different from NCI.   
Verb fluency scores: AD\<MCI\<SCI. MCI subjects    
performed poorer on verb fluency than other verbal fluency    
tasks   
Only 10% of MCI participants showed impaired motor    
speech performance. DDK rates for MCI were not    
significantly different from any group, except were    
significantly faster than PNFA.

**Principal Findings**   
No significant decline in expressive discourse after 6 months   
Compared to NCI, MCI showed impairments only in    
semantic fluency throughout the study period, and for    
phonemic fluency at year 6\. All other tests showed no    
significant differences between groups, after statistical    
adjustment for multiple comparisons   
After 2 years, 47 (23%) of MCI group had dementia and 9    
(5%) demonstrated normal cognitive function. 62% of MCI    
participants who progressed to dementia were initially    
impaired on semantic memory, and 40% on auditory    
comprehension.
