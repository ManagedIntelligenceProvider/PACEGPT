NATIONAL PACE ASSOCIATION   
FACT SHEET 

**Regulatory Considerations for the Use  of OTC and Social Needs Cards in PACE NPA Interpretive Guidance**    

July 2024 

The National PACE Association (NPA) understands that  some PACE organizations have received approval from their  respective Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)  Regional Office (RO) to provide some PACE participants  authorized over-the-counter (OTC) items (non-prescription  drugs and health-related items) and other benefits to help  meet participants’ basic needs (e.g., obtain food and grocery  items, defray utility expenses) in the form of a debit card or  other voucher. 

The following constitutes the current understanding or  interpretation by NPA of the federal regulatory permissibility  of PACE organizations offering these cards. This bulletin  does not constitute legal advice, nor does it reflect our  endorsement of specific vendor(s). NPA strongly encourages  PACE organizations interested in offering this type of  benefit to speak with their RO to obtain further guidance  and ultimately CMS approval prior to offering these cards.  Further, NPA strongly recommends that PACE organizations  discuss with their RO and state administering agency (SAA)  the federal and/or state compliance implications associated  with the provision.   
**NPA Interpretation of CMS Guidance** 

Federal PACE regulations at **42 CFR Part 460** do not expressly  address (or preclude) the provision of OTC or social needs  cards in PACE. However, in August 2023 CMS weighed in on  the matter via the **DMAO/PACE Portal** in response to a PACE  organization inquiry. (See Exhibit A.) NPA views the response  by CMS on this issue to suggest that OTC and similar cards  can be provided as a covered benefit by a PACE organization  for participants for whom it is necessary as determined by the  interdisciplinary team (IDT). Doing so seems consistent with  the response that the provision of these services (via the OTC  card) is “based on the individual needs of each participant”  and provided in accordance with all other applicable federal  regulatory requirements. 

Additionally, It is NPA’s interpretation of further  communications between PACE organizations and CMS that  it is appropriate to discuss OTC cards during the enrollment  process, but they cannot be used as an enticement. Doing so  would not be unlike a motorized scooter, for example, which  is a covered benefit if authorized/determined necessary  in a care plan. \[Of course, a participant can make a service  determination request (SDR) or appeal if they wish to refute  the denial of access to a covered benefit by the PACE  organization.\] 

While PACE organizations can provide the services  \[OTC benefit cards\] mentioned in your inquiry, they must  be provided based on the individual needs of each participant.

**Regulatory Considerations for the Use  of OTC and Social Needs Cards in PACE NPA Interpretive Guidance**

**Exhibit A: CMS Response to PACE Organization Question on OTC Card Use** 

**Member Question:** Dual Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs) and other Part C providers offer their members benefits via  a gift card that includes allowances for food and utilities, among other purchases. PACE programs provide these  services as part of the participant’s care plan, based on individualized assessments, as well as per participant’s service  determination request (SDR). Are PACE organizations permitted to provide a similar benefit more systematically, across  the board. to everyone rather than on a case-by-case basis? 

**CMS Response:** …In accordance with the CMS PACE regulations at **42 CFR § 460.92**, the PACE benefit package for all  participants, regardless of payment source, must include the following: 

(1) All Medicare-covered items and services. 

(2) All Medicaid-covered items and services, as specified in the state’s approved Medicaid plan. 

(3) Other services determined necessary by the interdisciplinary team to improve and maintain the participant’s overall  health status. Also note that Medicare and Medicaid benefit limitations and conditions relating to the amount,  duration, scope of services, deductibles, copayments, coinsurance or other cost-sharing do not apply \[**§ 460.90(a)**\]. 

As outlined at **§ 460.98(a)**, PACE organizations are responsible for providing care that meets the needs of each  participant across all care settings, 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and must establish and implement a written  plan to ensure that care is appropriately furnished. Furthermore, services must be provided as expeditiously as the  participant’s health condition requires, taking into account the participant’s medical, physical, emotional and social  needs. \[See **§ 460.98(b)(4)**.\] While PACE organizations can provide the services mentioned in your inquiry, they must be  provided based on the individual needs of each participant. \[NPA emphasis added.\] 

**Precedence in Other Federal Programs**  

There is significant (and growing) utilization of OTC or social  needs cards in Medicare Advantage (MA). Unlike PACE,  their provision is expressly authorized by CMS MA guidance.  Please refer to Chapter 4, Section 40, of the **Medicare  Managed Care Manual**. 

**Potential Vendors** 

While NPA does not endorse specified vendors to implement  the use of OTC or social needs cards in PACE, we understand  

that some PACE organizations have contracted with **InComm  Healthcare, Medline** and **Soda Health**, among other vendors.
