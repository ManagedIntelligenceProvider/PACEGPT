(i) An applicant may be considered to have failed to comply with the requirements of the PACE program under a PACE program agreement for purposes of an application denial under [paragraph (c)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.18#p-460.18\(c\)\(1\)) of this section if any of the following conditions apply with respect to the applicant during the applicable 12-month review period:  
(A) Was subject to the imposition of an enrollment or payment sanction under [§ 460.42(a)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.42#p-460.42\(a\)) or [(b)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.42#p-460.42\(b\)) for one or more of the violations specified in [§ 460.40](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.40).

(C) Filed for or is currently in State bankruptcy proceedings.  
(D) Met or exceeded 13 points for compliance actions for any one PACE program agreement.

(*i*) Each corrective action plan issued under [§ 460.19(c)(3)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.19#p-460.19\(c\)\(3\)) during the performance period counts for 6 points. Corrective action requests issued under [§ 460.194](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.194) are not included in the point calculations.  
(*ii*) Each warning letter issued under [§ 460.19(c)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.19#p-460.19\(c\)\(2\)) during the performance period counts for 3 points.  
(*iii*) Each notice of non-compliance issued under [§ 460.19(c)(1)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.19#p-460.19\(c\)\(1\)) during the performance period counts for 1 point.

This paragraph does not apply to a parent organization that completed the acquisition of a subsidiary that meets the criteria for denial within the 24 months preceding the application submission deadline.  
(d) If CMS has terminated a PACE program agreement under [§ 460.50](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.50), or did not renew a PACE program agreement, and that termination or non-renewal took effect within the 38 months preceding the submission of an initial or expansion PACE application from the same organization, CMS may deny the application based on the applicant's substantial failure to comply with the requirements of the PACE program, even if the applicant currently meets all of the requirements of this part.

(5) Whether the non-compliance was self-reported.  
(6) Other factors which relate to the impact of the underlying non-compliance or to the PACE organization's inadequate oversight of the operations that contributed to the non-compliance.  
(c) CMS may take one of three types of compliance actions based on the nature of the non-compliance.  
(1) *Notice of non-compliance.* A notice of non-compliance may be issued for any failure to comply with the requirements of the PACE organization's current or prior PACE program agreement with CMS and a State administering agency, as described in [paragraph (a)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.19#p-460.19\(a\)) of this section.

Cross Reference

Link to an amendment published at [90 FR 15921](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/90-FR-15921), Apr. 15, 2025\.  
(a) *Principle of payment.* Under a PACE program agreement, CMS makes a prospective monthly payment to the PACE organization of a capitation amount for each Medicare participant in a payment area based on the rate it pays to a Medicare Advantage organization.  
(b) *Determination of rate.*  
(1) The PACE program agreement specifies the methodology used to calculate the monthly capitation amount applicable to a PACE organization.  
(2) Except as specified in [paragraph (b)(4)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.180#p-460.180\(b\)\(4\)) of this section, the monthly capitation amount is based on the Part A and Part B payment rates established for purposes of payment to Medicare Advantage organizations. As used in this section, “Medicare Advantage rates” means the Part A and Part B rates calculated by CMS for making payment to Medicare Advantage organizations under section 1853(c) of the Act.  
(3) CMS will adjust the monthly capitation payment amount derived under [paragraph (b)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.180#p-460.180\(b\)\(2\)) of this section based on a risk adjustment that reflects the individual's health status. CMS will ensure that payments take into account the comparative frailty of PACE enrollees relative to the general Medicare population.  
(4) For Medicare participants who require ESRD services, the monthly capitation amount is based on the Medicare Advantage ESRD risk adjustment model.  
(5) CMS may adjust the monthly capitation amount to take into account other factors CMS determines to be appropriate.  
(6) The monthly capitation payment is a fixed amount, regardless of changes in the participant's health status.  
(7) The monthly capitation payment amount is an all-inclusive payment for Medicare benefits provided to participants. A PACE organization must not seek any additional payment from Medicare. The only additional payment that a PACE organization may collect from, or on behalf of, a Medicare participant for PACE services is the following:  
(i) Any applicable premium amount specified in [§ 460.186](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.186).  
(ii) Any charge permitted under [paragraph (d)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.180#p-460.180\(d\)) of this section when Medicare is not the primary payer.  
(iii) Any payment from the State, as specified in [§ 460.182](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.182), for a participant who is eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.  
(iv) Payment with respect to any applicable spenddown liability under [§§ 435.121](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-435.121) and [435.831 of this chapter](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-435.831) and any amount due under the post-eligibility treatment of income process under [§ 460.184](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.184) for a participant who is eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid.  
(8) CMS computes the Medicare monthly capitation payment amount under a PACE program agreement so that the total payment level for all participants is less than the projected payment under Medicare for a comparable population not enrolled under a PACE program.  
(c) *Adjustments to payments.* If the actual number of Medicare participants differs from the estimated number of participants on which the amount of the prospective monthly payment was based, CMS adjusts subsequent monthly payments to account for the difference.  
(d) *Application of Medicare secondary payer provisions* —  
(1) *Basic rule.* CMS does not pay for services to the extent that Medicare is not the primary payer under [part 411 of this chapter](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/part-411).  
(2) *Responsibilities of the PACE organization.* The PACE organization must do the following:  
(i) Identify payers that are primary to Medicare under [part 411 of this chapter](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/part-411).  
(ii) Determine the amounts payable by those payers.  
(iii) Coordinate benefits to Medicare participants with the benefits of the primary payers.  
(3) *Charges to other entities.* The PACE organization may charge other individuals or entities for PACE services covered under Medicare for which Medicare is not the primary payer, as specified in [paragraphs (d)(4)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.180#p-460.180\(d\)\(4\)) and [(5)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.180#p-460.180\(d\)\(5\)) of this section.  
(4) *Charge to other insurers or the participant.* If a Medicare participant receives from a PACE organization covered services that are also covered under State or Federal workers' compensation, any no-fault insurance, or any liability insurance policy or plan, including a self-insured plan, the PACE organization may charge any of the following:  
(i) The insurance carrier, the employer, or any other entity that is liable for payment for the services under [part 411 of this chapter](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/part-411).  
(ii) The Medicare participant, to the extent that he or she has been paid by the carrier, employer, or other entity.  
(5) *Charge to group health plan (GHP) or large group health plan (LGHP).* If Medicare is not the primary payer for services that a PACE organization furnished to a Medicare participant who is covered under a GHP or LGHP, the organization may charge the following:  
(i) GHP or LGHP for those services.  
(ii) Medicare participant to the extent that he or she has been paid by the GHP or LGHP for those services.

(2) Takes into account the comparative frailty of PACE participants.  
(3) Is a fixed amount regardless of changes in the participant's health status.  
(4) Can be renegotiated on an annual basis.  
(c) The PACE organization must accept the capitation payment amount as payment in full for Medicaid participants and may not bill, charge, collect, or receive any other form of payment from the State administering agency or from, or on behalf of, the participant, except as follows:  
(1) Payment with respect to any applicable spenddown liability under [§§ 435.121](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-435.121) and [435.831 of this chapter](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-435.831) and any amounts due under the post-eligibility treatment of income process under [§ 460.184](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.184).  
(2) Medicare payment received from CMS or from other payers, in accordance with [§ 460.180(d)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-460.180#p-460.180\(d\)).  
(d) State procedures for the enrollment and disenrollment of participants in the State's system, including procedures for any adjustment to account for the difference between the estimated number of participants on which the prospective monthly payment was based and the actual number of participants in that month, are included in the PACE program agreement.

#### 

§ 460.184 Post-eligibility treatment of income.

(a) A State may provide for post-eligibility treatment of income for Medicaid participants in the same manner as a State treats post-eligibility income for individuals receiving services under a waiver under section 1915(c) of the Act.  
(b) Post-eligibility treatment of income is applied as it is under a waiver of section 1915(c) of the Act, as specified in [§§ 435.726](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-435.726) and [435.735 of this chapter](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/section-435.735), and section 1924 of the Act.

#### 

§ 460.186 PACE premiums.

The amount that a PACE organization can charge a participant as a monthly premium depends on the participant's eligibility under Medicare and Medicaid, as follows:
