**I. Executive Summary**  

*A. Purpose*  

The purpose of this final rule is to  revise and update the requirements for  the Programs of All-Inclusive Care for  

the Elderly (PACE) under the Medicare  and Medicaid programs. The rule  addresses application and waiver  procedures, sanctions, enforcement  actions and termination, administrative  requirements, PACE services,  

participant rights, quality assessment  and performance improvement,  participant enrollment and  

disenrollment, payment, federal and  state monitoring, data collection, record  maintenance, and reporting. The  changes will provide greater operational  flexibility, remove redundancies and  outdated information, and codify  existing practice.  

*B. Summary of Key Economic Provisions*  1\. Compliance Oversight Requirements    
Compliance programs, as found in the  Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicare  Part D programs, have long been  recognized as key to protecting against  fraud, waste, and abuse. The importance  of these programs has been highlighted  by several of our oversight bodies. In the  August 16, 2016 **Federal Register** (81 FR  54666), we published the proposed rule,  entitled ‘‘Medicare and Medicaid  Programs; Programs of All-Inclusive  Care for the Elderly (PACE).’’ In that  rule, as authorized by sections 1934(f)(3)  and 1894(f)(3) of the Social Security Act  (the Act), we proposed to adopt two key  elements of the Part D compliance  program in the PACE regulations.  Specifically, we proposed to require  each PACE organization (PO) to develop  a compliance oversight program that  will be responsible for monitoring and  auditing its organization for compliance  with our regulations. Additionally, we  proposed to require POs to have  measures that prevent, detect and  correct non-compliance with CMS’  program requirements, as well as  measures that prevent, detect, and  correct fraud, waste, and abuse. We  received comments that indicated these  requirements would potentially present  a significant burden to POs and possibly  take key staff away from providing  

participant care. After careful    
consideration of these concerns, and  after re-analyzing the burden estimates,  we are finalizing this provision in part.  

2\. Monitoring and Oversight of PACE  Organizations  

As a result of our experience with  oversight and monitoring of the PACE  program, we proposed flexibilities in  connection with the current  

requirement that POs be monitored for  compliance with the PACE program  requirements during and after a 3-year  trial period. We stated in the proposed  rule that we must balance the  

responsibilities of ensuring that all of  our beneficiaries are receiving quality  care with our duty to effectively manage  our resources and ensure proper  oversight over all of the programs we  manage. We proposed to use technology  to enhance efficiencies in monitoring by  remotely reviewing PO documents,  which we have to date reviewed  primarily through site visits. We also  proposed to reduce the number of on site visits after the 3-year trial period by  utilizing a risk assessment to select  which POs will be audited each year.  We stated in the proposed rule that this  risk assessment would rely primarily on  an organization’s past performance and  ongoing compliance with CMS and state  requirements. However, the risk  assessment would also take into account  other information that could indicate a  PO needs to be reviewed, such as  participant complaints or access to care  concerns. We are finalizing the  provisions related to federal and state  monitoring as proposed.  

3\. Additional Flexibility for    
Interdisciplinary Team  

This final rule makes several changes  intended to expand the flexibilities of  the interdisciplinary team (IDT) that  comprehensively assesses and provides  for the individual needs of each PACE  participant. Key provisions in this final  rule include permitting one individual  to fill two separate roles on the IDT if  the individual has the appropriate  licenses and qualifications for both  roles, and permitting the primary care  provider that is required for each IDT to  include nurse practitioners, physician  assistants and community-based  physicians, in addition to physicians.  Another flexibility we are finalizing in  this rule is removal of the requirement  that members of the IDT must serve  primarily PACE participants.

TABLE 1—SUMMARY OF COSTS AND BENEFITS 

| Total costs to POs  |
| :---: |

Provision description Total cost to government  (without transfer)  

Compliance Oversight Require ments.   
This provision requires POs to create a compliance oversight  program to allow prompt identification of non-compliance  and report of fraud, waste and abuse. We estimate a one time burden of $116,026.8 in the first year for developing  the written materials and training necessary for the prompt  identification and reporting of fraud, waste and abuse (124  PO ⋅ 15 hours per PO ⋅ 62.38 (hourly rate)). This cost  when annualized over 3 years is $38,675.6. We further es timate an annual cost of $154,702 per year for POs report ing and responding to any suspected fraud, waste and  abuse (124 PO ⋅ 20 hours per PO ⋅ $62.38 hourly rate).  Thus, the total cost would be $38,675.6 initially and  $154,702 afterwards.   
The creation of this program does not have  cost or savings to the government since it is  the POs who are creating and using the  compliance oversight program.  

Monitoring ................................. This provision reduces the required monitoring by CMS of  POs. We estimate that there will be an annual savings to    
POs based on our proposal of $1,523,253. We expect 72    
PO audits under the current regulations but only 35 audits    
as a result of this final rule. Consequently, the savings to    
PO would be the effort saved by not having to produce    
documentation and other administrative burdens that occur    
during an audit for 37 audits. Consequently, we are esti   
mating the savings per audit for a PO to be approximately    
$41,169 (1 Nurse Manager at $53.69/hour ⋅ 2 (Factor for    
fringe benefits) ⋅ 150 hours per person plus 1 Executive    
Assistant at $28.56/hour ⋅ 2 (Factor for fringe benefits) ⋅    
150 hours per person) plus 1 Medical Record Technician at    
20.59/hour ⋅ 2 (Factor for Fringe benefits) ⋅ 150 hours per    
person plus 1 Compliance Officer at 34.39/hour ⋅ 2 (Factor    
for Fringe benefits) ⋅ 150 hours per person). Therefore, the    
total savings to POs will be $41,169 ⋅ 37 \= $1,523,253.   
We estimate an annual savings of $2,638,144  to the government. We expect 72 PO audits  under current regulations. We expect only  35 audits under this final rule. The savings  to the government would be the effort  saved by not having to perform 37 audits.    
The cost per audit is 2 GS–13 ⋅ $1,980 travel  \+ 200 hours for GS–13s ⋅ $46.46/hr GS–13  wage ⋅ 2 (Fringe benefit factor) \+ 60 hours  for GS–15s ⋅ $64.59/hr GS–15 wage ⋅ 2  (Fringe benefit factor) \+ 20 hours for 1 GS–  13 ⋅ 46.46/hr GS–13 wage ⋅ 2 (Fringe ben   
efit factor) \= $71,301.20. Hence, the total  savings is $71,301.20 ⋅ 37 \= 2,638,144.  The audit work includes all of the pre-audit  work, including (i) compiling and (ii) submit ting audit documentation; (iii) 2 weeks of  audit fieldwork; the post-audit work of (iv)  collecting and (v) submitting impact anal yses, (vi) reviewing and (vii) commenting on  the draft audit report, and (viii) submitting  and (ix) implementing corrective action  plans for conditions of non-compliance.  

Additional Flexibility for the  Inter-disciplinary Team (IDT).   
This provision provides administrative flexibility for POs with out compromising care by: (i) Permitting one individual to  fill two separate roles on the IDT if the individual has the  appropriate licenses and qualifications for both roles; (ii)  permitting the primary care provider (required for each IDT)  to include nurse practitioners, physician assistants and  community-based physicians, in addition to physicians; and  (iii) removing the requirement that members of the IDT  must serve primarily PACE participants. While this provi   
sion provides greater flexibility in creating the IDT, it does  not create cost or savings.   
This provision has neither cost nor savings to  the government due to the fact that many  POs are currently exercising these flexibili ties through PACE waivers.  

Participant Assessments ........... The provision provides clarity on initial assessments, removes  duplicative requirements for periodic reassessments, and    
provides greater flexibility for unscheduled reassessments.    
More specifically: The provision clarifies that: (i) Initial as   
sessments must be done in-person and prior to completion    
of the plan of care (within 30 days); (ii) reassessments    
must be done semi-annually and requires a minimum of    
three IDT members; (iii) ‘‘change in participant status’’ re   
assessments require a minimum of three (instead of eight)    
IDT members; and (iv) remote technology may be used to    
conduct certain reassessments for participant requests that    
will likely be deemed necessary to improve or maintain the    
participants overall health status. The use of remote tech   
nologies to conduct these reassessments for participant re   
quests under § 460.104(d)(2) results in savings from re   
duced travel costs for PO staff and PACE participants. We    
are scoring this as a qualitative savings since there are    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
challenges with quantifying it. Similarly, the other provisions    
are qualitative savings to POs.   
These provisions will not result in additional  costs or savings to the government.

TABLE 1—SUMMARY OF COSTS AND BENEFITS—Continued  

| Total costs to POs  |
| ----- |
| This provision provides states and POs the ability to adapt to  potential payment rate changes and variations by allowing  the inclusion of the Medicaid payment rate methodology in  the PACE program agreement instead of the actual rates.  Although this provision may reduce the burden of POs hav  ing to update agreements to include the actual Medicaid  payment rates, this is not a mandatory requirement and we  are not scoring this change since some states may elect to  continue to include the Medicaid rates.   This provision allows CMS the discretion to take less punitive  action, such as sanctions or CMPs, when authorized to ter minate a PO. Because the provision authorizes lesser  sanctions under the existing disciplinary process, the provi sion has neither cost nor savings to POs.   This provision allows an electronic and automated PACE ap plication and waiver process. Since this provision codifies  existing practice it results in neither costs nor savings.   The provision strengthens beneficiary protections by prohib iting POs from: (i) Using agents/brokers that are not directly  employed by the PO to market PACE programs, unless ap propriately trained; (ii) unsolicited marketing by direct con tact, including phone calls and emails. Since the purpose of  prohibiting these marketing practices is to strengthen exist ing beneficiary protections, this provision is not considered  a cost or savings. |

PACE Program Agreement—In clude Medicaid Rate Method ology.   
Since this is an option on the part of states,  and some states may continue to elect to  include the actual Medicaid rates in the pro gram agreement, and because CMS will  continue to review and approve state Med icaid PACE capitation rates, there is neither  cost nor savings to the government.  

Enforcement Actions .................Because the provision authorizes lesser sanc tions under the existing disciplinary process,    
the provision has neither cost nor savings    
to the government.  

Application Process ..................This provision codifies existing practice, and  therefore, has neither cost nor savings to    
the government.    
PACE Marketing .......................This provision has neither cost nor savings to  the government.  

**II. Background**  

*A. Program Description*  

The PACE program is a unique model  of managed care service delivery for the  frail elderly, most of whom are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid  

benefits, and all of whom are assessed  as being eligible for nursing home  

placement according to the Medicaid  standards established by their respective  states.  

*B. Legislative and Regulatory History*  1\. Demonstration Project  

Section 603(c) of the Social Security  Amendments of 1983 (Pub. L. 98–21), as  extended by section 9220 of the  

Consolidated Omnibus Budget    
Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA)  (Pub. L. 99–272), authorized the original  demonstration PACE program for On  Lok Senior Health Services (On Lok) in  San Francisco, California. Section  

9412(b) of the Omnibus Budget    
Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1986    
(Pub. L. 99–509), authorized CMS to  conduct a PACE demonstration program  to determine whether the model of care  developed by On Lok could be  

replicated across the country. The    
number of sites was originally limited to  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
10, but the OBRA of 1990 (Pub. L. 101–  508\) authorized an increase to 15 PACE  demonstration programs. The PACE  demonstration program was operated  under a Protocol published by On Lok,  Inc. as of April 14, 1995\.  

The PACE model of care includes, as  core services, the provision of adult day  health care and IDT care management,  through which access to and allocation  of all health services is managed.  Physician, therapeutic, ancillary, and  social support services are furnished in  the participant’s residence or on-site at  a PACE center. Hospital, nursing home,  home health, and other specialized  services are generally furnished under  contract. Financing of the PACE  demonstration model was accomplished  through prospective capitation  payments under both Medicare and  Medicaid. Under section 4118(g) of the  OBRA of 1987 (Pub. L. 100–203), PACE  demonstration programs had to assume  full financial risk progressively over the  initial 3 years. As such authority was  removed by section 4803(b)(1)(B) of the  Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA)  (Pub. L. 105–33), PACE demonstration  programs approved after August 5, 1997  had to assume full financial risk at start up.  

2\. Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA)  (Pub. L. 105–33)  

Section 4801 of the BBA authorized  coverage of PACE under the Medicare  program by amending title XVIII of the  Act to add section 1894 of the Act,  which addresses Medicare payments  and coverage of benefits under PACE.  Section 4802 of the BBA authorized the  establishment of PACE as a state option  under Medicaid by amending title XIX  of the Act and adding section 1934 of    
the Act, which directly parallels the  provisions of section 1894 of the Act.  Section 4803 of the BBA addresses  implementation of PACE under both  Medicare and Medicaid, the effective  date, timely issuance of regulations,  priority and special consideration in  processing applications, and extension  and transition for PACE demonstration  project waivers.    
As directed by section 4803 of the  BBA, we published an interim final rule  with comment period (IFC) on  November 24, 1999, establishing  requirements for PACE under sections  1894 and 1934 of the Act (64 FR 66234).  The 1999 IFC was a comprehensive rule  that addressed eligibility, administrative  requirements, application procedures,  services, payment, participant rights,  and quality assurance under PACE.  

3\. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP  Benefits Improvement and Protection  Act of 2000 (BIPA) (Pub. L. 106–554)  

The following three sections of BIPA  modified the PACE program:    
• Section 901 extended the transition  period for the PACE demonstration  programs to allow an additional year for  these organizations to transition to the  permanent PACE program.    
• Section 902 gave the Secretary of  Health and Human Services (the  Secretary) the authority to grandfather  in the modifications these programs had  implemented as of July 1, 2000\. This  provision allowed the PACE  

demonstration programs to continue

program modifications they had    
implemented and avoid disruptions in  participant care where these  

modifications were determined to be  consistent with the PACE model.    
• Section 903 specifically addressed  flexibility in exercising the waiver  

authority provided under sections    
1894(f)(2)(B) and 1934(f)(2)(B) of the  Act. It authorized the Secretary to  

modify or waive PACE regulatory    
provisions in a manner that responds  promptly to the needs of PACE  

organizations (POs) relating to the areas  of employment and the use of  

community-based primary care    
physicians. Section 903 of BIPA also  established a 90-day review period for  waiver requests. On October 1, 2002, we  issued an IFC to implement section 903  of BIPA (67 FR 61496).  

4\. Medicare Prescription Drug,    
Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108–173)  

On December 8, 2003, Congress    
enacted the MMA. Several sections of  the MMA affected POs. Most notably,  section 101 of the MMA affected the  way in which POs are paid for  

providing certain outpatient    
prescription drugs to any Part D eligible  participant. The MMA altered the  

payment structure for Part D drugs for  POs by shifting the payer source for  PACE enrollees who are full-benefit  dual-eligible individuals from Medicaid  to Medicare, and, in part, from the  

beneficiary to Medicare for individuals  that are not full-benefit dual-eligible  beneficiaries who elect to enroll in Part  D. The MMA did not affect the manner  in which POs are paid for the provision  of outpatient prescription drugs to non part D eligible PACE participants.    
Section 101 of the MMA added    
section 1860D–21(f) of the Act, which  provides that POs may elect to provide  qualified prescription drug coverage to  enrollees who are Part D eligible  

individuals. The MMA allows CMS the  flexibility to deem POs as MA plans  with prescription drug coverage (MA–  PD) local plans and to treat POs that  elect to provide qualified drug coverage  in a manner similar to MA–PD local  plans. Due to inconsistencies in the  PACE and MMA statutes, we chose to  treat POs in a similar manner as MA–  PD plans, thereby avoiding conflicting  requirements. The requirements that  apply to POs that elect to provide  

qualified prescription drug coverage to  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
Part D eligible enrollees are described in  section II.T.3. of the January 2005 Part  D final rule (70 FR 4426 through 4434).    
In addition, section 236 of the MMA  amended the Act to extend to POs the  existing statutory Medicare and  

Medicaid balance billing protections  that had previously applied to POs  under the PACE demonstration program  authority.  

Section 301 of the MMA amended the  Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP)  provisions in section 1862(b) of the Act.  These amendments clarify the  

obligations of primary plans and  primary payers, the nature of the  insurance arrangements subject to the  MSP rules, the circumstances under  which Medicare may make conditional  payments, and the obligations of  primary payers to reimburse Medicare.  To implement section 301 of the MMA,  we issued an IFC published in the  February 24, 2006 **Federal Register** (71  FR 9466). The provisions in the IFC  were finalized in a final rule published  in the February 22, 2008 **Federal  Register** (73 FR 9679). The IFC revised  pertinent MSP regulations found at 42  CFR part 411\. Our PACE regulations at  § 460.180(d) specify that Medicare does  not pay for PACE services to the extent  that Medicare is not the primary payer  under part 411\. The MSP regulations  found at 42 CFR part 411 set forth our  current policies regarding MSP  obligations involving other payers.  

5\. 2006 PACE Final Rule  

On December 8, 2006, we issued a  final rule (71 FR 71244\) (hereinafter  2006 final rule) that finalized both the  PACE IFC published in the November  24, 1999 **Federal Register** (64 FR 66234\)  and the PACE IFC published in the  October 1, 2002 **Federal Register** (67 FR  61496).  

For a complete history of the PACE  program, please see the 2006 final rule  (71 FR 71244 through 71248).  

*C. PACE Regulatory Framework*  

Sections 1894(f) and 1934(f) of the Act  set forth the requirements for issuing  regulations to carry out sections 1894  and 1934 of the Act. Sections 1894(f)(2)  and 1934(f)(2) of the Act state that the  Secretary must incorporate the  requirements applied to PACE  demonstration waiver programs under  the PACE Protocol when issuing interim  final or final regulations, to the extent  consistent with the provisions of  sections 1894 and 1934 of the Act.  However, the Secretary may modify or  waive these provisions under certain  circumstances. Sections 1894(a)(6) and  1934(a)(6) of the Act define the PACE  Protocol as the Protocol for PACE as  published by On Lok, Inc., as of April  14, 1995, or any successor protocol that  may be agreed upon between the  Secretary and On Lok, Inc. We issued  the 1999 and 2002 IFCs and the 2006    
final rule under authority of sections  1894(f) and 1934(f) of the Act.    
We believe sections 1894(f) and  1934(f) of the Act primarily apply to  issuance of the initial interim and final  PACE program regulations because they  refer to the PACE Protocol,1 which has  now been replaced by the PACE  program agreement.2 Sections  

1894(f)(2)(B) and 1934(f)(2)(B) of the Act  permit the Secretary to modify or waive  provisions of the PACE Protocol as long  

as any such modification or waiver is  not inconsistent with and does not  impair any of the essential elements,  objectives, and requirements of the  PACE Protocol and, in particular, does  not modify or waive any of the  following five provisions:    
• The focus on frail elderly qualifying  individuals who require the level of care  provided in a nursing facility.    
• The delivery of comprehensive  integrated acute and long-term care  services.    
• The IDT approach to care    
management and service delivery.  • Capitated, integrated financing that  allows the PO to pool payments  received from public and private  programs and individuals.  

• The assumption by the PO of full  financial risk.    
While we believe sections 1894(f) and  1934(f) of the Act no longer have direct  application to the PACE program in  many respects, we believe the  

limitations on waivers and    
modifications continue to apply to  updates to the PACE program to the  extent the updates concern essential  elements, objectives, and requirements  of the PACE Protocol, as replaced by the  PACE program agreement, or any of the  five listed provisions.  

**III. Summary of the Provisions of the  Proposed Rule, and Analysis of  Responses to Public Comments**  

In the August 16, 2016 proposed rule,  we proposed to revise and update the  policies finalized in the 2006 final rule  to reflect subsequent changes in the  practice of caring for the frail and  elderly and changes in technology (for  example, the use of electronic  

communications, including email, and  the automation of certain processes)  based on our experience implementing  and overseeing the PACE program. We  explained in the proposed rule that  PACE has proven successful in keeping  frail, older individuals, many of whom  are eligible for both Medicare and

Medicaid benefits (dual eligibles), in  community settings.3 However, it is  necessary to revise some regulatory  provisions to afford more flexibility to  POs and state administering agencies  (SAAs) as a means to encourage the  expansion of the PACE program to more  states, thus increasing access for  

participants, and to further enhance the  program’s effectiveness at providing  care while reducing costs. Therefore, we  proposed a number of flexibilities,  

including allowing non-physician    
medical providers practicing within the  scope of their state licensure and  

clinical practice guidelines to serve in  place of primary care physicians in  some capacities, and permitting POs to  better tailor the IDTs to improve  

efficiency, while continuing to meet the  needs of their participants.    
We received approximately 110    
public comments on the proposed rule  from POs, individuals, health care  

providers, advocacy groups, and states.  In the sections that follow, we describe  each proposed provision, summarize  any public comments received on each  provision, and provide our responses to  the comments.  

*A. Global Change Regarding Quality  Assessment and Performance*  

*Improvement*  

Part 460 encompasses the regulatory  provisions pertaining to PACE. We  

proposed to replace all references to  ‘‘quality assessment and performance  improvement’’ in part 460 of the  

regulations (including subpart and    
section headings) with ‘‘quality    
improvement.’’ We noted in the    
proposed rule that we proposed this  change because, in practice, the term  ‘‘quality improvement’’ is used by the  POs, SAAs, CMS, and the industry  

when referring to quality assessment  and performance improvement for POs.  Furthermore, the term ‘‘quality  

improvement’’ is used to mean the same  thing in other CMS programs, such as  the CMS Quality Improvement  

Organization Program and the MA    
Quality Improvement Program, so this  change would allow for consistency in  use of language across CMS programs.  We stated that this would be a change  

in terminology only and would not  designate a change in the requirements  for the PACE quality program. As  

proposed, the change would affect the  following sections and headings in the

current regulations: §§ 460.32(a)(9),  460.60(c), 460.62(a)(7), 460.70(b)(1)(iii),  460.120(f), 460.122(i), 460.130(a),  460.132(a) and (c)(3), 460.134(a),  460.136(a), (b), (c), (c)(1) and (2),  460.138(b), and 460.172(c), and the  headings of subpart H and §§ 460.132,  460.134, and 460.136. We noted in the  proposed rule that, because we were  proposing to remove § 460.140 in its  entirety, we would not need to change  the reference in that section.    
As we received no comments on this  global change, we are finalizing it as  proposed.  

*B. Subpart A—Basis, Scope, and  Definitions*  

1\. Part D Program Requirements  (§ 460.3)  

In the 2006 final rule (71 FR 71248),  we indicated that MA–PD requirements  with respect to Part D prescription drug  

coverage would apply to POs that elect  to provide qualified Part D prescription  drug coverage. However, the PACE  regulations make no mention of Part D  program requirements. To clarify this  policy, we proposed to add § 460.3,  ‘‘Part D Program Requirements,’’ to state  that the POs offering qualified  

prescription drug coverage and meeting  the definition of a Part D plan sponsor  (as defined at § 423.4) must abide by all  applicable Part D program requirements  in 42 CFR part 423\. We explained in the  proposed rule that when we issue Part  D program guidance we often receive  questions regarding applicability to  PACE, and it has been our experience  that POs are not always aware they must  comply with Part D requirements unless  a specific requirement has been waived.  (For a list of the Part D regulatory  requirements that are waived for POs,  see section 2.4 of the Part D application  for new POs, available at *https:// www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prescription Drug-Coverage/PrescriptionDrug CovContra/RxContracting*\_ 

*ApplicationGuidance.html.*) We stated  that we believed the proposed change is  consistent with our current policy and  does not involve any change in the  current treatment of POs offering  qualified Part D prescription drug  coverage.    
The following is a summary of the  public comments we received on the  proposed provision regarding Part D  program requirements and our  

responses to comments.    
*Comment:* Several commenters  generally supported the proposal to  include in the PACE regulations the  requirement that POs offering Part D  qualified prescription drug coverage  comply with Part D program    
requirements in 42 CFR part 423\.  However, one commenter requested that  the regulatory text include a list of Part  D requirements that are waived for  PACE and suggested that CMS issue  Health Plan Management System  (HPMS) guidance specifying which Part  D requirements are applicable to PACE.  The same commenter requested that  CMS audits take into account  

differences between PACE and MA–PDs  and Medicare prescription drug plans  (PDPs). The commenter also requested  that CMS help in reducing Part D  premiums and other costs for PACE  participants.    
*Response:* Regarding the suggestion to  list in the PACE regulations the specific  Part D requirements that are waived for  PACE, we prefer to maintain our current  approach of listing the waived  

regulations in the Part D application for  new POs, as well as the PACE program  agreement. We believe our approach  provides greater administrative  flexibility (for example, to remove or  add waived requirements) than if we  codified the list in regulation. Further,  we believe listing the waived  

regulations in the Part D PACE  application is appropriate so that this  information is readily available to all  entities submitting an application.  However, we agree that when we need  to change how a waiver of Part D  requirements is applied in PACE, or  revoke a waiver based on new  

information or legal requirements, we  should issue guidance to address those  changes. For example, we will be  issuing an HPMS memo to clarify the  requirements for drug management  programs in PACE to reflect the  regulatory changes made in the final  rule to implement the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) (83  FR 16440). Because the other comments  concerning audits and assistance with  reducing premiums and other costs  address topics that were not covered in  our proposal, we consider those  comments to be outside the scope of this  rule. We are finalizing the new § 460.3  as proposed, with one technical change  to refer to the definition of a Part D  sponsor ‘‘in’’ § 423.4 instead of ‘‘at’’  § 423.4.  

*C. Subpart B—PACE Organization  Application and Waiver Process*  

1\. Purpose (§ 460.10)  

Section 460.10 describes the purpose  of subpart B, which sets forth the  processes for an entity to apply to  become a PO and to apply for a waiver  of certain regulatory requirements. We  proposed to revise this section to add a  new paragraph (a) to address the  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25615**  

application process and a new    
paragraph (b) in which we proposed to  move the current language in this  

section regarding the waiver process by  which a PO may request a waiver of  certain regulatory requirements. We also  proposed to add § 460.10(a)(2) and (3) to  describe the process for a PO to seek  approval from CMS to expand an  

existing service area or add a new PACE  center. We did not receive any  

comments on this proposal, and    
therefore, we are finalizing it as    
proposed.  

2\. Application Requirements (§ 460.12)  

Section 460.12 sets forth the    
application requirements for an    
organization that wishes to participate  in the PACE program. Section 460.12(a)  currently requires an individual  

authorized to act for an entity to submit  a complete application to CMS that  describes how the entity meets all  

requirements in part 460 if the entity  seeks approval from CMS to become a  PO. As set forth in our PACE manual,  an application must also be submitted  for a PO that seeks to expand its service  area and/or add a new PACE center site  (see PACE Manual, Ch. 17, Sections 20.4  through 20.7). There are three scenarios  specified in the PACE manual under  which a PO may expand operations: (1)  It may expand its geographic service  area without building additional sites;  (2) it may open another physical site in  the existing geographic service area; and  (3) it may expand its geographic service  area and open another physical site in  the expanded area. Currently, POs are  required to submit an application to  CMS and the SAA to expand their  

geographic service area and/or add a  new PACE center to their PO. In October  2004, we released the PACE expansion  application, which was for existing POs  that wish to expand their geographic  service areas, and/or add a new PACE  center to their PO.    
As with initial applications, our    
guidance requires POs to submit an  expansion application to CMS through  the SAA. However, current regulations  do not specify a process for POs to  

submit, and the SAA and CMS to    
approve, an expansion application.    
Therefore, we proposed to amend    
§ 460.12(a) to specify that it also applies  to expansion applications submitted by  existing POs that seek to expand their  service area and/or to add a PACE  

center site. Specifically, we proposed to  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
add language in § 460.12(a) that an    
individual authorized to act for a PO  that seeks to expand its service area  and/or add a PACE center site must  submit a complete application to CMS  that describes how the PO meets all  

requirements in this part. We stated in  the proposed rule that we believed  including this requirement in § 460.12  will help ensure POs understand our  current practice of requiring an  expansion application for a PO that  seeks to expand its service area and/or  add a PACE center site.    
We also proposed to add the phrase  ‘‘in the form and manner specified by  CMS’’ to § 460.12(a) when describing  the submission to CMS of a complete  application to become a PO or to expand  a service area and/or add a PACE center,  to allow for submission of applications  and supporting information in formats  other than paper, which was the  required format at the time the proposed  rule was issued. As we explained in the  proposed rule, paper applications were  often hundreds of pages long, expensive  to reproduce and transmit, and  administratively inefficient, as staff  reviewing different parts of the  application are located in different  physical locations and must receive  hard copies of the material. We noted  that to adapt to the increased use of  electronic communications, electronic  health records, and electronic data  storage and exchange, we must  continuously update the form and  manner by which we administer our  programs. We stated that we had  successfully transitioned the MA  application and PDP application to a  fully electronic submission process,  enabling a more organized and  streamlined review, and wanted to bring  those same efficiencies to the PACE  application process. We also noted that  we will provide further guidance on this  process through HPMS or similar  electronic system that may replace  HPMS. Effective March 31, 2017, the  first quarterly application submission  date, we required POs to submit all  applications electronically via HPMS,  including initial applications, and  applications for existing POs to expand  their service area and/or add a PACE  center site. POs and applicants may also  refer to the CMS online tools for  application submission at *https:// www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/  PACE/Overview.html.*    
Section 460.12(a)(2) provides that we  would accept applications from entities  that seek approval as POs beginning on  February 22, 2000, except we would  

accept applications on earlier dates for  certain entities that qualify for priority  processing or special consideration. We  established this provision and two other  sections of the PACE regulations,  previously found at § 460.14 and  § 460.16, to implement section 4803(c)  of the BBA of 1997\. Section 4803(c)  directed us to give priority in processing    
applications, during the 3-year period  following enactment of the BBA of 1997,  to PACE demonstration programs and  then to entities that had applied to  operate a PACE demonstration program  as of May 1, 1997\. In addition, section  4803(c) of the BBA of 1997 required that  we give special consideration in the  processing of applications during the 3  years following enactment to any entity  that as of May 1, 1997, had indicated  specific intent to become a PO through  formal activities such as entering into  contracts for feasibility studies. In the  2006 final rule (71 FR 71253), we  deleted § 460.14 (Priority Consideration)  and § 460.16 (Special Consideration)  because the authority to provide these  considerations expired on August 5,  2000\. For the same reason, in the  proposed rule, we proposed to delete  paragraph (a)(2) of § 460.12, as it is no  longer applicable.    
Section 460.12(b) provides that an  entity’s application must be  

accompanied by an assurance from the  SAA of the state in which the program  is located indicating that the state (1)  considers the entity to be qualified to be  a PO and (2) is willing to enter into a  PACE program agreement with the  entity. However, we have received  applications without the required SAA  assurance. To help ensure that our  current policy is clear, we proposed to  revise the language to require that the  entity’s application to become a PO  include an assurance from the SAA that  the state considers the entity to be  qualified to be a PO and the state is  willing to enter into a PACE program  agreement with the entity. We explained  in the proposed rule that we want  entities to understand we would not  consider an application to become a PO  to be complete without assurance from  the SAA that the state both considers  the entity to be qualified to be a PO and  is willing to enter into a PACE program  agreement with the entity. We noted  that we would not review applications  that do not include this assurance.    
Similarly, we proposed to redesignate  paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) as  

§ 460.12(b)(1) and add a new paragraph  (b)(2) to codify the current requirement  in the PACE expansion application that  a PO’s application to expand its service  area and/or add a new PACE center site  must include an assurance from the  

SAA that the state is willing to amend  the PACE program agreement to include  the new PACE center sites and/or  expand the PO’s service area. We noted  that we also expect, as we stated in the  preamble to the 1999 IFC for initial  applications (64 FR 66238), that the  SAA will verify that an applying entity  has qualified administrative and clinical

staff employed or under contract prior  to furnishing services to participants in  the expanded service area.    
In addition, we proposed to move the  language in § 460.22, which requires an  entity to state in its application the  

service area it proposes for its program,  and provides that CMS (in consultation  with the SAA) may exclude an area  already covered under another PACE  program agreement, to proposed  

paragraph § 460.12(c) and remove    
§ 460.22. As proposed, § 460.12(c)(1)  would specify that both an entity  

submitting an application to become a  PO and a PO submitting an application  seeking to expand its service area must  

describe the proposed service area in  their application. We also proposed to  make a corresponding change to the  Medicare Part D definition of ‘‘Service  area’’ in § 423.4 for PACE plans offering  qualified prescription drug coverage by  removing the reference to ‘‘§ 460.22 of  this chapter’’ and adding in its place  ‘‘§ 460.12(c) of this chapter,’’ as our  proposed changes would move the  

language currently in § 460.22 to    
§ 460.12(c).    
Finally, to codify CMS’ current    
practice regarding the permissibility of  POs to expand their service area and/or  add a new PACE center site (see PACE  Manual, Ch. 17, Section 20.4), we  

proposed to add § 460.12(d), which  would provide that CMS and the SAA  will only approve an expansion  

application after the PO has successfully  completed its first trial period audit  and, if applicable, has implemented an  acceptable corrective action plan.4   
We stated in the proposed rule that    
we believed all of these changes to    
§ 460.12 would streamline the    
regulations and make the requirements  clear and consistent with the PACE  statutes. We noted that we will provide  subregulatory guidance on application  submission requirements after  

publication of the final rule.    
A discussion of the comments we    
received on the proposed changes to the  application requirements, and our  

responses to those comments, appears  below.    
*Comment:* One commenter questioned  how the state will ensure that the  

required state assurance that is to    
accompany an initial or expansion    
application is accurate without    
additional monitoring. The commenter  also questioned if the state will be  

required to perform additional

documentation) to prove that an  expanding PO is indeed qualified to  expand its service area or add an  additional PACE center.    
*Response:* The PACE regulations  currently require that an entity’s  application to become a new PO be  accompanied by an assurance from the  SAA that the state considers the entity  to be qualified to be a PO and is willing  to enter into a PACE program agreement  with the entity. In proposing to revise  § 460.12(b), we sought to clarify in the  regulations that, similar to the  

requirement for an initial application,  the SAA must provide an assurance to  us that the state is willing to expand the  existing PACE program agreement to  add to an existing service area and/or  add a new PACE center. Given that we,  in cooperation with the SAA, already  conducts ongoing monitoring of a PO,  we expect the state will determine what  if any additional information is needed  from a PO before providing the required  assurance. As required by Chapter 17 of  the PACE manual (Sections 10, 20.6,  20.7 and 30.2), if the PO is seeking to  expand by adding a new PACE center,  the SAA is responsible for conducting  the state readiness review (SRR) of the  PACE center to ensure that it meets the  regulatory requirements for  

environment and staffing, and must  provide the results to us before the  expansion application can be approved.  *Comment:* Some commenters  

expressed support for CMS’ proposal to  modernize the application process for  entities that seek to become new POs or  to expand existing service areas or add  new PACE center sites, acknowledging  that the electronic exchange of  information will expedite the processing  of applications and be less burdensome  for both POs and CMS.    
*Response:* We thank the commenters  for their support.    
*Comment:* A variety of commenters,  including PACE associations, supported  the proposed requirements related to the  

submission of initial applications by  entities seeking to become POs, as well  as applications submitted by POs to  expand their geographic service areas.  Commenters recommended that CMS  not require a PO to submit a formal  expansion application in order to add a  new PACE center within an existing  service area. Commenters suggested that  instead of requiring an expansion  application for a new PACE center, CMS  only require a PO to provide advance  notification (a minimum of 60 days in  advance) at any time (not limited to the  quarterly application submission cycle),  and report specific information (for  example, location of the new PACE  center, SAA assurance of support,    
willingness to amend the PACE program  agreement, attestation of financial  solvency with supporting  

documentation as evidence of the  program’s financial capacity, etc.), along  with a completed SRR prior to the  opening of the new PACE center.  Commenters suggested that  

subsequently, but still prior to the new  PACE center’s opening, the PO would  submit any revised marketing materials  to CMS for review. Some commenters  also suggested that a similar process,  with no expansion application  requirement, would be sufficient for  circumstances in which a PO is simply  moving a PACE center to a new location  and relocating the IDT. Other  

commenters noted that removing the  current requirement to submit  

applications on a quarterly cycle would  enable POs to open a new PACE center  more quickly to build capacity in  response to increasing enrollment.    
*Response:* We do not agree with the  suggestion to remove the expansion  application requirement for existing POs  seeking to add a new PACE center  within an existing service area for a  number of reasons. First, the submission  of an expansion application in which  the PO seeks to add a new PACE center  in an existing service area ensures that  a structured, formalized process is  employed consistently, regardless of  expansion type, and ensures that the PO  is providing proper assurances that  PACE requirements are being met and  that appropriate documentation is  provided and included as part of the  PACE program agreement. Furthermore,  an expansion application requirement  benefits both CMS and the PO, as both  parties are held accountable and are  required to adhere to established  timeframes and deadlines. Perhaps most  importantly, the submission of a formal  expansion application, regardless of  type, enables us to make a  

determination based on a standardized  mechanism and affords the PO the  opportunity to request reconsideration  of denials by us. Regarding commenters’  suggestion that a similar alternative  process, with no expansion application  requirement, could also be employed  when a PO is simply moving a PACE  center to a new location and relocating  the IDT, we would point to our  guidance that addresses expectations of  POs under these circumstances. (See the  October 21, 2016 HPMS memorandum,  PACE Replacement Center Transition  Guidance.) POs that seek to relocate an  existing PACE center should follow this  subregulatory guidance.    
*Comment:* A commenter suggested  that the SRR be appropriately tailored to  situations in which a PO is applying to

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25617**  

either expand its service area or add a  new PACE center site, stating that the  SRR in these instances should not be the  equivalent to an SRR conducted for and  included in an initial application.    
*Response:* We note that an SRR is not  required for service area expansion  

(SAE) applications that do not include  the addition of a new PACE center. We  recognize that the SRR is typically the  

primary driver of delay in final approval  when a PO applies for an expansion that  includes the addition of a new PACE  center site. However, the SRR is also a  critical component of an expansion  application that includes a new PACE  center, as it assures that all state-based  licensure requirements are met and  building and safety codes are satisfied.  The SRR primarily consists of reviewing  requirements specific to the PACE  

center itself, such as construction,    
equipment and maintenance to assure  physical safety of participants and  

personnel. While there are some SRR  requirements that may remain the same  as the existing PACE center(s), such as  transportation, contracts and policies  and procedures, that may not be the  case if the new PACE center is  

geographically distant from the existing  PACE center. For example, there may be  a different transportation provider or  other new contractors that are more  accessible to the new PACE center  

location. Because of those variables, we  believe it would be difficult to tailor the  current SRR for an expansion  

application that includes addition of a  new PACE center.    
*Comment:* Some commenters    
requested that CMS specify in § 460.12  that an expansion application will not  have to include information previously  submitted to CMS as part of the initial  application. Another commenter noted  

that streamlining the administrative  process removes a burden for both POs  and CMS in processing these  

applications.    
*Response:* While SAE applicants were  previously required to submit a smaller  subset of documents than initial PACE  applicants, in March 2018, as part of the  first quarterly application submission  cycle, CMS began requiring SAE  

applicants to respond to the same    
attestations and upload the same    
documentation as initial PACE    
applicants. The PACE program    
agreement is the binding document  between the PO, CMS and the SAA. We  have found that program agreements,  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
particularly for POs that have been    
active for some time, may not fully    
represent current operational policies  and procedures and other information  that is required content of the program  agreement under § 460.32. We  

understand commenters’ concerns  regarding the potential burden  associated with SAE applicants having  to upload documents previously  submitted as part of an initial  

application. However, in addition to  providing added assurance and  evidence that an active PO is qualified  to expand its PACE program, we believe  the application process is an  

appropriate, efficient and effective  vehicle for capturing documentation  that is required as part of the PO’s PACE  program agreement, including changes  to operational policies and procedures,  and eliminates the need to require the  PO to submit additional information  separately. While not explicitly  addressed in this rule, we note that  comments received from the PACE  industry in response to an information  collection request (CMS–10631, OMB  0938–1326) regarding this approach for  SAE applications have generally  indicated support for requesting  information as part of the SAE  

application itself in order to facilitate  efforts to update the PACE program  agreement. This information collection  request is subject to renewal and expires  on December 31, 2021\.    
We believe this approach results in a  more streamlined process and reduced  burden for all parties to the PACE  program agreement.    
*Comment:* Commenters expressed  support for the proposed provision in  § 460.12(d), which would require a PO  to have completed its first trial period  audit and, if applicable, implemented  

an acceptable corrective action plan  before CMS and the SAA will approve  a service area expansion or PACE center  expansion, with two specific  

modifications. Commenters requested  an exception to this requirement when  the PO is relocating its PACE center to  

a new location due to unforeseen  circumstances or to assure adequate  access if program growth exceeds  enrollment projections. In addition,  because the timing of the first trial  period audit affects the ability of a PO  to grow, commenters requested that  CMS and the SAA commit to  

conducting trial period audits in a  timely manner, with an expectation that  the first year audit be completed no later  than 15 months after the opening of the  PACE program.    
*Response:* We appreciate the support  for the proposed provision in  

§ 460.12(d) and acknowledge that  unforeseen or otherwise exceptional  circumstances, such as storm damage  from a hurricane, may require a PO to  immediately relocate its PACE center  prior to completion of the first trial  period audit. In situations that    
constitute emergency events, we would  expect the PO to implement its  emergency preparedness plan under  § 460.84, which should include  established plans and procedures for  continued care of all participants,  including those who had previously  required regular PACE center  

attendance, as well as those who  predominantly or exclusively receive  care at home or in alternative care  settings, as applicable. In the event such  emergency circumstances require the  relocation of a PACE center, either on a  temporary or permanent basis, we  would work with the PO and the SAA  to ensure that the PO’s emergency  preparedness plan is implemented  effectively and in a manner that  maintains the health and safety of  participants and staff. Such  

circumstances vary widely and present  unique challenges; and we will expect  the PO, to the extent possible, to address  the items identified in the transition  plan included as part of the October 21,  2016 HPMS memorandum, PACE  Replacement Center Transition Plan  guidance, while recognizing that the  guidance may need to be tailored in  response to the emergency situation  presented. The priority under such  circumstances will be to ensure that  participants continue to receive  necessary medical care and IDT  members are able to continue to  function and serve the needs of  participants in a safe environment,  regardless of setting. We would not  require submission of an expansion  application in this type of emergency  situation, and do not believe it is  necessary to amend § 460.12(d) to  address unforeseen or otherwise  exceptional circumstances.  

We also do not agree that an    
exception should be made to allow  relocation of a PACE center prior to  completion of the first trial period audit  in order to assure adequate access if  program growth exceeds enrollment  projections. A PO that intends to  relocate its PACE center in order to  satisfy increased enrollment demands  would be required to wait until the first  trial period audit is successfully  completed. We believe this is reasonable  because it enables us to ensure the PO  is satisfying all requirements of the  PACE program within the initial  enrollment capacity constraints prior to  accommodating increased enrollment.  We also appreciate the comment  regarding the timing of the first review  during the trial period. We are  

committed to conducting timely annual  reviews during each contract year of the  PO’s trial period. We will continue to

schedule reviews as expeditiously as  possible consistent with statutory and  regulatory requirements for the PACE  program.    
After considering the comments, we  are finalizing the changes to § 460.12 as  proposed.  

3\. CMS Evaluation of Applications    
(§ 460.18)  

Section 460.18 describes the    
information that CMS uses to evaluate  an application under PACE; however,  this does not take into account all the  

potential sources of information that  may be a part of the evaluation process,  including information used in the  

evaluation of applications submitted for  a PO that seeks to expand its service  area and/or add a new PACE center site.  Currently, § 460.18(b) specifies that  CMS will use information obtained  

through on-site visits conducted by  CMS or the SAA. Section 460.18(c)  

provides that CMS will use information  obtained by the SAA. As discussed  

earlier in this section, we proposed to  revise our regulations to reflect that an  application also must be submitted for  

a PO that seeks to expand its service  area and/or add a new PACE center site.  We explained in the proposed rule that  in evaluating expansion applications,  CMS may consider additional  

information beyond that contained in  the application itself, information  

obtained through on-site visits, or    
information obtained through the SAA.  For example, our review of a SAE  

application might include information  obtained from financial reviews, as well  as the results from ongoing monitoring  visits. Therefore, we proposed to  

combine the language currently in    
§ 460.18(b) and (c) in revised § 460.18(b)  and delete § 460.18(c). The revised  

§ 460.18(b) would state that CMS uses  information obtained by CMS or the  SAA through on-site visits or any other  means. We noted that this change would  take into account the additional  

information that we use to review any  PACE application, including  

applications to expand a PO’s service  area or add a new PACE center site. We  also proposed to make a conforming  change to the introductory language in  § 460.18 to reflect the review of  

expansion applications, by deleting ‘‘for  approval as a PACE organization.’’    
A discussion of the comments we    
received on the proposed changes to the  application evaluation requirements,  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
and our responses to those comments,  appears below.    
*Comment:* One commenter noted the  proposed modification would enable  CMS to use information obtained by  CMS or the SAA through on-site visits  

or any other means in order to evaluate  a PACE application, and requested  clarification regarding what  

encompasses ‘‘any other means.’’  *Response:* As we stated in the  

proposed rule (81 FR 54671), it is our  intent to capture all the potential  sources of information that may be part  of the application evaluation process.  Information obtained by ‘‘any other  means’’ may include, but is not limited  to, information obtained through the  SAA, from financial reviews, or from  ongoing monitoring visits.    
We are finalizing the modifications to  § 460.18 as proposed.  

4\. Notice of CMS Determination  (§ 460.20)  

Section 460.20 describes requirements  for CMS to notify PACE applicants of  the status of PACE applications.  Currently, § 460.20 only specifies the  requirements for CMS determination of  applications submitted by entities  seeking to become POs. As previously  discussed in this section, we proposed  to amend the regulations in subpart B to  include, in addition to requirements for  applications from entities seeking to  become POs, requirements for  

applications submitted by existing POs  for service area and/or PACE center site  expansions. In conjunction with that  proposal, we proposed changes to  § 460.20 to also include specific  language regarding the notification  requirements for CMS determination of  applications to expand a PO’s service  area and/or to add a new PACE center.    
As we explained in the proposed rule,  the current requirements in § 460.20  implement sections 1894(e)(8) and  1934(e)(8) of the Act, which require that  an application for PO status be deemed  approved unless the Secretary, within  90 days after the date of the submission  of the application to the Secretary,  either denies such request in writing or  informs the applicant in writing with  respect to any additional information  that is needed in order to make a final  determination with respect to the  application. The Act further states that,  after the date of receipt of any  

additional requested information from  the applicant, the application must be  deemed approved unless the Secretary,  within 90 days of such date, denies such  request.    
While the Act requires that CMS  provide notice to entities seeking to  become POs of its determination within  90 days, the Act does not set out  requirements for applications submitted  by existing POs to expand their service  area and/or to add a new PACE center  site. We have published expansion  application requirements in Chapter 17    
of the PACE manual, available at *http://  www.cms.gov/Regulations-and Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Internet Only-Manuals-IOMs-Items/*  

*CMS019036.html.* Under that guidance,  a PO is required to submit an expansion  application when the PO is seeking to  (1) expand its geographic service area;  (2) add a new PACE center; or (3)  expand its geographic service area and  add a new PACE center.    
The guidance provides that, when a  PO submits an expansion application to  expand its geographical service area  without building additional sites, CMS  has 45 days to request additional  information from the PO, approve the  application, or deny the application.  Similarly, when a PO submits an  expansion application to add a new  PACE center in the existing service area,  CMS has 45 days to request additional  information from the PO, approve the  application, or deny the application. In  these scenarios, if CMS requests  additional information and the  applicant provides the requested  information, CMS has an additional 45  days to review and either approve or  deny the expansion application. The  second 45-day review period in this  scenario only commences once CMS has  received all of the additional requested  material. If the applicant submits  additional information per CMS’  request, but CMS determines that there  is still outstanding information  requested from the applicant, CMS  notifies the applicant and the additional  45-day review period does not begin  until all requested information is  received. Once we have received all of  the requested information, CMS sends a  letter to the applicant indicating that the  second 45-day review period has  commenced.    
In the third scenario, when a PO  submits an expansion application to  expand its geographic service area and  open a new PACE center site, CMS has  90 days to request additional  

information from the PO, approve the  application, or deny the application. In  this scenario, if CMS requests additional  information and the PO provides the  requested information, CMS has an  additional 90 days to review and either  approve or deny the expansion  application. The second 90-day review  period in this scenario only commences  once CMS has received all of the  additional requested material. If the  applicant submits additional  

information per CMS’ request, but CMS  determines that there is still outstanding  information requested from the  applicant, CMS notifies the applicant  and the additional 90-day review period  does not begin until all requested

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25619**  

information is received. Once CMS has  received all of the requested  

information, CMS sends a letter to the  applicant indicating that the second 90-  day review period has commenced.  We proposed to codify our current  

subregulatory requirements for notifying  POs of CMS determinations regarding  service area and PACE center site  

expansion applications so the    
regulations include all of the relevant  application timing requirements.  

Specifically, we proposed to amend  § 460.20(a) to make it clear that the  

notice of CMS determination applies to  all three types of applications listed in  proposed § 460.10(a), and that the 90-  day time limit applies, except for  

applications to expand the service area  or add a new PACE center site.    
First, we proposed to delete    
§ 460.20(a)(3) and revise § 460.20(b).  Currently, § 460.20(a) states that CMS  will approve or deny, or request  

additional information on, a ‘‘complete  application’’ within 90 days after  

submission of the application. We    
explained in the proposed rule that we  believe it is confusing to state that an  application is complete if we are  

requesting additional information.    
Therefore, we proposed to delete    
§ 460.20(a)(3), which is the provision  that describes CMS requesting  

additional information needed to make  a final determination, and we proposed  to revise § 460.20(b) to state that an  application is only considered complete  when CMS receives all information  necessary to make a determination  

regarding approval or denial. We noted  that we would not consider the  

application complete without the    
required state assurance. We also    
proposed to revise § 460.20(a) to specify  that the time limit for CMS notification  of determination is 45 days for  

expansion applications where a PO  seeks to expand its service area or add  a new PACE center.    
Next, we proposed that § 460.20(b)    
through (d) be redesignated as    
§ 460.20(c) through (e) and revised as  follows. We proposed to revise  

redesignated § 460.20(c) to describe the  process if CMS determines that the  

application is not complete because it  does not include sufficient information  for CMS to make a determination.  

Specifically, CMS would inform the  entity that the application is not  

complete and request the additional  information, and within 90 days (or 45  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
days for a service area or new PACE  center expansion application) of CMS  receiving all requested information from  the entity, CMS would approve the  

application or deny it and notify the  entity in writing of the basis of the  

denial and the process for requesting  reconsideration of the denial. We  explained in the proposed rule that we  proposed these changes because it is not  possible for CMS to make an informed  decision to approve or deny an  application in situations where we do  not have all of the pertinent  

information. We stated we would  consider the SRR, which SAAs conduct  to determine the PO’s readiness to  administer the PACE program and  enroll participants, as information  necessary to make our final  

determination and would request that  the SRR be submitted in all applicable  requests for additional information if we  did not already have this information.  We further noted that, if more than 6  months elapse between the date of  submission of the application and the  response to CMS’ request for additional  information, the entity is required to  update the application to provide the  most current information and materials  related to the application; otherwise, we  would consider the application  incomplete. We proposed to revise  § 460.20(c) accordingly.    
Section 460.20(b), which we proposed  to redesignate as § 460.20(c), currently  outlines the requirements for POs when  CMS requests from an entity additional  information needed to make an  application determination. As noted  previously, we proposed to amend the  language in this provision to address the  different time limits for expansion  applications. We also proposed to  amend the language to specify that the  time limits in § 460.20(a) do not begin  until CMS receives all requested  information and the application is  complete. As we explained in the  proposed rule, with the changes to  § 460.20(a) and the addition of  § 460.20(b), it would no longer be  necessary to describe CMS’ review  process after all requested information  has been received; thus, we proposed to  remove § 460.20(b)(1) and (2).    
Section 460.20(c), which we proposed  to redesignate as § 460.20(d), currently  implements sections 1894(e)(8) and  1934(e)(8) of the Act and provides that  an application for PO status will be  deemed approved if CMS fails to act on  it within 90 days of the date the  application is submitted or the date  CMS receives all requested additional  information. We proposed to amend this  language to specify deemed approval  will occur if CMS fails to act after the  later of those dates, and that the  provisions relating to deemed approval  only apply to applications to become a  PO, not expansion applications from  existing POs. We stated in the proposed  rule that this revision is necessary    
because, as described previously, we  proposed to address expansion  applications in the regulations, and we  wanted to make it clear that only initial  applications will be deemed approved if  CMS fails to act on them within the  required time period. As previously  noted, the PACE statutes do not set out  requirements for applications submitted  by existing POs to expand their service  area and/or to add a new PACE center  site. We explained in the proposed rule  that CMS does not currently employ  ‘‘deemed approval’’ for expansion  applications, and we noted we do not  believe there is any reason to do so for  these applications at this time. We  further proposed to amend this language  by specifying that the 90-day period  commences after CMS has received a  ‘‘complete’’ application, as this is  consistent with the amendments to  § 460.20(a) and § 460.20(b).    
Finally, § 460.20(d) currently states  that for purposes of the 90-day time  limit described in this section, the date  that an application is submitted to CMS  is the date on which the application is  delivered to the address designated by  CMS. We proposed to redesignate  § 460.20(d) as § 460.20(e), and revise  this paragraph to refer to the time limits  described in this section to include  applications for service area expansions  or new PACE center sites.    
A discussion of the comments we  received on the proposed changes to the  CMS notice of determination  

requirements, and our responses to  those comments, appears below.  *Comment:* Commenters questioned  the necessity of the proposed provision  that would require PACE applicants to  update their applications if more than 6  months elapse between the date of  initial submission of the application and  the entity’s response to the CMS request  for additional information. Commenters  also questioned whether CMS was  proposing to require the applicant to  withdraw its application and resubmit  an entirely new application, or if CMS  would permit less burdensome and  timelier ways to update the existing  application through submission of  additional information. Commenters  recommended the latter approach, and  suggested allowing 12 months, as  opposed to 6 months, to elapse between  the date of application submission and  the entity’s response to the request for  additional information before the entity  is required to update its application.  Commenters also recommended that the  submission of additional information  not be subject to CMS’ quarterly  submission timeframes for applications.  *Response:* After careful consideration  of the comments, we have reconsidered  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00011 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**25620 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

the timeframe that would require an  update to the application. We agree with  commenters that there may be valid  reasons for delay in responding to our  request for additional information (for  example, unexpected delays in  

construction or licensing of the PACE  center, or timing of the SRR); therefore,  we accept the recommendation made by  commenters and will specify that if  more than 12 months, instead of 6  

months, elapse between the date of    
initial submission of the application and  the entity’s response to our request for  additional information, the entity must  update the application with the most  current information and materials  

related to the application. This means  that, in addition to addressing the  

additional information requested by us,  the applicant must submit all other  

application-specific documentation that  may have changed during the interim  12-month period. We note that,  

depending on the nature of those    
changes and updates, there may be    
circumstances in which the applicant  will be required to submit a completely  new application; for example, if there is  a change in the legal entity that is  

applying to become a PO.    
With respect to commenters’    
recommendation that the submission of  additional information not be subject to  quarterly submission timeframes, we  note that responses to a request for  

additional information are not limited to  a quarterly submission cycle. While the  application itself (initial or expansion)  must be submitted on the established  quarterly dates, information in response  to a request for additional information  may be submitted at any time.    
*Comment:* We received comments in  response to the proposed provision  

regarding deemed approval of initial  applications. One commenter did not  believe that an application should be  

deemed approved due to CMS’ inability  to review and act on an application  within the required timeframes. This  commenter believed that all  

documentation submitted to fulfill an  application as complete must be  

reviewed and approved by CMS without  any deemed approval. Other  

commenters noted that CMS, in the  preamble to the proposed rule, stated  that it does not believe it is necessary to  allow deemed approval for expansion  applications, as it has not done so in the  past. Commenters requested that CMS  reconsider this position and allow    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
deemed approval of applications from  POs seeking to expand a service area,  with or without adding a new PACE  center. While recognizing that CMS has  always acted on expansion applications  within the timeframes required for  

initial applications, the commenters  stated there is no reason to preclude  deemed approval if CMS is unable to act  on an expansion application in a timely  manner for some reason.    
One commenter stated that, in cases  in which the deemed approval  requirement is triggered, it is still  necessary for CMS to issue confirmation  that deemed approval took place in  order to effectively track the status of  the review process.    
*Response:* Sections 1894(e)(8) and  1934(e)(8) of the Act require an  application for PO status to be deemed  approved unless the Secretary, within  90 days after the date of the submission  of the application to the Secretary,  either denies the request in writing or  informs the applicant in writing with  respect to any additional information  that is needed to make a final  

determination. The Act further states  that, after the date of receipt of any  additional requested information from  the applicant, the application must be  deemed approved unless the Secretary,  within 90 days of such date, denies such  request. As we noted in the proposed  rule, the PACE statutes do not  

specifically address expansion  applications. As such, we proposed to  specify in redesignated § 460.20(d) that  the deemed approval requirement only  applies to entities that submit an initial  application. As stated in the proposed  rule, we do not currently employ  deemed approval for expansion  applications and we do not believe there  is valid reason to employ deemed  approval for expansion applications at  this time. We appreciate the recognition  from commenters that we have, to date,  rendered decisions regarding expansion  applications within the timeframes  required for initial applications;  however, we do not want to be in a  position in which a deeming process  supersedes our ability to make  thoughtful, proactive decisions  regarding these expansion applications.  Therefore, we are finalizing our  proposal that the deemed approval  requirement will not apply to expansion  applications.    
Regarding the comment that we must  issue confirmation that an application  has been deemed approved, we note  that the automated PACE application  system sends communications to  applicants regarding the status of their  application, and applicants would  receive formal notification of any  deemed approval in the approval letter  that accompanies the applicant’s  executed PACE program agreement. In  light of these communications, we do  not believe separate CMS confirmation  of deemed approval is necessary.    
However, based on the input received,  we will consider modifications to our  auto-generated communications to  include additional information  regarding timeframes for review.  

*Comment:* One commenter explained  the process one specific SAA must  undergo in order to effectuate service  area expansions and expansions  involving new PACE centers, and  suggested that CMS and the SAA  consider ways to better coordinate and  shorten the timeframes for approval of  expansion applications. The commenter  noted that CMS has 90 days after  submission of the SRR to make a  determination with regard to the  application and questioned whether it  would be possible to allow a PACE  center to open immediately upon  receipt of the completed SRR.  

*Response:* We note that our review  timeframe may be 45 or 90 days  depending on the type of expansion  application. While we seek to review  expansion applications as expeditiously  as possible, adequate time must be  afforded to us to review all aspects of an  application, including responses to any  requests for additional information, as  well as the SRR. As a party to the PACE  program agreement, we must carefully  review all elements of the application,  including the SRR, and therefore, would  not consider allowing a PACE center to  begin operations immediately upon our  receipt of the SRR. We note that, even  after we receive the SRR and any  information submitted in response to a  request for additional information and  we determine the application is  approvable, we require additional time  to amend and execute the PACE  program agreement and ensure that  proper steps have been taken to  accommodate enrollment of participants  and payment to the PO. Within the past  year, we have significantly expedited  the effective date for approvals of  expansion applications, often making  them effective upon the date of approval  of the expansion application.  

After carefully considering all    
comments, we are finalizing § 460.20 as  proposed, with one modification. Under  § 460.20(c)(2), an entity will be required  to update its application if more than 12  months, as opposed to 6 months, elapse  

between the date of initial application  submission and the entity’s response to  the CMS request for additional  information.  

5\. Service Area Designation (§ 460.22)  

As discussed in section III.C.2. of this  final rule, we proposed to move the  content of § 460.22, in its entirety but  with a few revisions, to § 460.12(c).  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00012 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25621**  

Therefore, we proposed to delete    
§ 460.22.    
A discussion of the comments we    
received on this proposed change, and  our responses to those comments,  

appears below.    
*Comment:* One commenter questioned  whether the proposed removal of  

§ 460.22 means that zip code expansions  will no longer be required, and if so,  whether expansion information will be  documented as part of PACE program  agreement updates.    
*Response:* We assume the commenter  is questioning whether expansion  

applications from POs that seek to    
expand their approved geographic    
service area will no longer be required.  We address application requirements  specific to service area expansions in  section III.C.2. of this final rule.  

However, we wish to clarify that we  proposed to move the current content of  § 460.22 to § 460.12(c), which is why we  proposed to delete § 460.22. We note  that a description of the service area  will still be required as part of the  

application, in accordance with existing  requirements and documented as part of  Appendix C of the PACE program  

agreement.    
*Comment:* A few commenters    
addressed the provision that states CMS,  in consultation with the SAA, may  

exclude from designation an area that is  already covered under another PACE  program agreement to avoid  

unnecessary duplication of services and  avoid impairing the financial and  

service viability of an existing program.  One commenter expressed support for  this provision. Another commenter  

expressed appreciation of CMS’ goal  and emphasized the word ‘‘may’’ in this  provision, as some degree of  

competition between PACE programs in  the same geographic area may be useful  to ensure adherence to minimum  

quality standards and encourage the  provision of quality services.    
*Response:* We note that this provision  is based on sections 1894(e)(2)(B) and  1934(e)(2)(B) of the Act, and it is not a  new provision or revision to an existing  provision. Rather, we are simply moving  the provision, in its current form, from  § 460.22(b) to § 460.12(c)(2). As a result,  we proposed to delete § 460.22(b). After  considering the comments, we are  

finalizing this change as proposed.    
*Comment:* One commenter expressed  support for current provisions that  

require clearly-defined geographic    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
service areas for both initial and    
expansion applications. The commenter  also expressed the need to ensure  

flexibility regarding the designation of  service areas. The commenter noted that  traditional reliance on boundaries  

defined by county lines or Core Based  Statistical Areas (CBSA) may prove  arbitrary in terms of reflecting the actual  distribution of a population in need of  services. The commenter also noted  innovations such as telehealth are  redefining traditional concepts of a  service area, in both rural and urban  settings. The commenter stated that  flexibility in defining service areas  enhances the ability to target PACE  services to populations that could  support and benefit from coverage by  more than one PO; for example, there  could be situations in which a new PO  seeking to enter a market is willing to  introduce innovation or serve a  specialized population that an existing  PO is unable or unwilling to match.    
*Response:* We note that § 460.32(a)(1)  allows the service area of a PO to be  identified by county, zip code and other  means. Therefore, applicants are not  necessarily bound by traditional  geographic designations. With respect to  the comment regarding innovative  service delivery approaches that could  be considered when defining service  areas, we appreciate this input and may  consider it as part of subregulatory  guidance or rulemaking in the future.  *Comment:* One commenter  

acknowledged that both the current and  proposed regulations require an  applicant entity to identify the service  area the PACE program wishes to serve,  noting, specifically, that CMS, in  consultation with SAAs, may exclude  an area that is already being served by  another PACE program agreement. One  commenter noted that Tribal Health  Programs (THPs) have a unique  relationship with the American Indian/  Alaska Native (AI/AN) beneficiaries  they are contracted to serve.  

Specifically, AI/AN beneficiaries have  the ability under Medicaid to receive  services from a THP, even when the AI/  AN is enrolled in a managed care  product, and the THP has the right to  receive reimbursement for services  provided. Therefore, the commenter  requested that CMS specify an  

exception to the service area designation  requirement to allow THPs to identify  the Indian Health Service (IHS) Service  Area in their application, even if a non Indian PACE program already exists in  all or part of that IHS Service Area.    
*Response:* We interpret the comment  to be specific to a THP that may apply  to offer a PACE program. We note that,  under § 460.32(a)(1), a service area may  be defined by county, zip code and  certain other means including tribal  jurisdictional area, as applicable, and  this is explicitly stated in the PACE  application. We further note that the  regulatory language currently in    
§ 460.22(b) states that CMS, in    
consultation with the SAA, may exclude  from designation an area that is already  covered under another PACE program  agreement to avoid any unnecessary  duplication of services and avoid  impairing the financial and service  viability of an existing program.  Whether another PO is currently serving  a designated service area is therefore a  consideration in the potential exclusion  of that area, not an absolute requirement  for exclusion.    
After considering the comments, we  are finalizing the changes to § 460.22 as  proposed.  

6\. Submission and Evaluation of Waiver  Requests (§ 460.26)  

Section 460.26 sets forth the process  for submitting and evaluating waiver  requests. We proposed to revise current  § 460.26(a)(1) and (2) so that  

§ 460.26(a)(1) would state that a PO, or  an entity submitting an application to  become a PO, must submit its waiver  request through the SAA for initial  review. Paragraph (a)(1) would also  specify that the SAA forwards waiver  requests to CMS along with any  concerns or conditions regarding the  waiver. We proposed that section  460.26(a)(2) would state that entities  submitting an application to become a  PO may submit a waiver request as a  document separate from the application  or in conjunction with and at the same  time as the application. While we did  not propose any policy changes in the  proposed rule, we stated that we  believed these changes would make the  requirements for submission of the  waiver request more concise and clear.  We noted that we plan to provide  additional detail on this part of the  process in subregulatory guidance.    
Section 460.26(b) states that CMS  evaluates a waiver request from a PO on  the basis of certain information. We  proposed to add ‘‘or PACE applicant’’  after ‘‘PACE organization’’ because a  waiver request can be submitted by an  existing PO or a PACE applicant (an  entity that has applied to be a PO but  is not yet a PO, or a PO applying to  expand its service area and/or add a  new PACE center site).    
A discussion of the comments we  received on the proposed changes to the  waiver process requirements, and our  responses to those comments, appears  below.    
*Comment:* We received many    
comments in support of the proposed  changes to the waiver submission  process language. Commenters also  requested clarification on whether  waiver requests can be submitted as part  of an entity’s initial application or

**25622 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

whether the waiver requests have to be  submitted to CMS by the SAA.    
*Response:* Under our current process,  entities submitting an application to  become a PO may submit a waiver  

request either as a separate document or  in conjunction with their initial  

application. We are adding language to  § 460.26 to clarify that an applicant may  submit a separate waiver request  

through the SAA or the applicant may  submit a waiver request in conjunction  with and at the same time as the initial  

application, now that the application  submission process is automated. As  previously required, a waiver request  submitted with an initial application  must include a letter from the SAA  

indicating the State’s concurrence,    
concerns, or conditions related to the  waiver request. We note that our review  of any waiver requests submitted in  conjunction with the initial application  will be reviewed in accordance with the  90-day review period for waiver  

requests in § 460.28. We are making one  additional change to § 460.26(a)(1) to  refer to the SAA’s concurrence, as well  as any concerns or conditions, regarding  the waiver, to align that provision with  the proposed requirement in  

§ 460.26(a)(2) for waiver requests    
submitted in conjunction with initial  applications.    
*Comment:* One commenter expressed  concern that we have not included  

provisions for broader waiver types that  address a systematic issue and noted the  example of hiring social workers with a  

bachelor’s degree instead of a master’s  degree in areas where it is difficult to  hire a Master’s-level social worker. The  commenter recommended that POs be  afforded the ability to request a blanket  waiver, meaning no limitation on the  effective period of the waiver, to allow  targeted flexibility for a specific,  

documented purpose, such as in the  example cited. In the absence of  

additional flexibilities, the commenter  stated that POs may have to submit  

multiple waiver requests over time to  address the same type of flexibility,  which is a time-consuming and costly  process for POs.    
*Response:* With the exception of the  requirements specified in § 460.26(c),  POs have broad latitude to request  

waivers to address localized, systematic  issues on a long-term basis, such as the  example cited by the commenter, as  long as all waiver requirements are met.  In addition, we believe the revisions we  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
are making to the regulations in this  final rule will result in fewer waiver  requests. Specifically, the additional  flexibilities we are providing, such as  

the changes to the IDT requirements at  § 460.102, will permit POs to operate  

their programs with these flexibilities  and no longer require POs to request  waivers of those requirements. For  example, we are finalizing changes to  allow community-based physicians to  serve as the primary care provider on  the IDT. Prior to these regulatory  changes, POs would have had to request  a waiver of this requirement in order for  a community-based physician to  function in the role of the primary care  physician on the IDT.    
*Comment:* One commenter requested  that when CMS is seeking to deny a  waiver request that the SAA reviewed  and supports, there should be  

provisions in place for consultation  with the state before CMS makes a final  determination. The commenter  acknowledged this practice is already in  place; however, the commenter would  like it to be codified in the regulations  to ensure consistency.    
*Response:* We consult with the SAA  on all waiver requests and do not  believe it is necessary to codify this  practice in our regulations. We intend to  clarify this practice in future guidance.    
After considering the comments, we  are finalizing the proposed changes to  § 460.26 in part, with modifications to  clarify that an applicant may submit a  separate waiver request through the  

SAA, per the quarterly deadlines, or the  applicant may submit a waiver request  in conjunction with and at the same  time as the initial application, and a  change to § 460.26(a)(1) to refer to the  SAA’s concurrence, as well as any  concerns or conditions, regarding the  waiver.  

7\. Notice of CMS Determination on  Waiver Requests (§ 460.28)  

Section 460.28 discusses the    
timeframes for CMS determination and  notification regarding approval or denial  of waiver requests. As we explained in  the proposed rule, we established this  section to implement section 903 of  BIPA, which provides in relevant part  that the Secretary shall approve or deny  a request for a modification or a waiver  not later than 90 days after the date the  Secretary receives the request. We  proposed to retain most of the language  in current § 460.28(a), but to specify that  the 90-day time limit starts after CMS  receives a complete waiver request. We  discuss the need for a complete waiver  request in subsequent paragraphs. In  § 460.28(a), we proposed to revise the  heading to ‘‘General,’’ delete the  reference to a denial being ‘‘in writing,’’  and state that CMS will take action on  the complete waiver request in the form  and manner specified by CMS. We  proposed these changes to reflect how  we provide notification, whether    
electronically or in another format. We  noted in the proposed rule that CMS  would not only provide notification  verbally. We proposed to redesignate  § 460.28(a)(2) as new § 460.28(a)(3).  We proposed to add a new  

§ 460.28(a)(2) to address conditional  approval of a waiver request from a  PACE applicant when the application is  still pending. We explained in the  proposed rule that under CMS’ current  process, a PACE applicant may request  a waiver while its application is still  pending and receive either a denial of  the waiver request or a conditional  approval of the waiver request. The  approval of the waiver request is  conditioned on the approval of the  application. CMS will only issue  conditional approvals to entities with  pending applications. We noted that  issuing a conditional approval enables  CMS to adhere to the BIPA 90-day  timeframe for making a determination  with respect to a waiver request in  situations where an application is still  under review. Waiver requests that are  not associated with a pending  

application either receive an approval or  denial.    
In addition, we proposed to remove  the language in § 460.28(b) regarding the  date of receipt of the waiver, because we  

believed the proposed changes to  § 460.28(a) and (b) make it clear that the  90-day clock will start on the day CMS  receives a complete waiver request. We  also proposed to change current  paragraph (c)(1) regarding deemed  approval of a waiver request to refer to  CMS failing to act within 90 days of  receipt of a complete waiver request,  and redesignate it as paragraph (c). We  stated that CMS will notify POs to  confirm receipt of ‘‘complete’’ waiver  requests.    
We proposed new language in    
§ 460.28(b) regarding additional  information requests for waivers. We  explained in the proposed rule that  unlike sections 1894(e)(8) and  

1934(e)(8) of the Act, which give CMS  90 days to request additional  

information from entities applying to  become POs, section 903 of BIPA does  not explicitly impose a time limit for  CMS to request additional information  that is necessary to make a  

determination on a waiver request. In  the 2006 final rule, we stated that there  is ‘‘no statutory authority to stop the 90-  day clock if additional information is  necessary to make a determination on a  waiver request.’’ (71 FR 71255). We  noted in the proposed rule that although  we cannot stop the clock, we believe the  statute can be read to start the 90-day  clock upon CMS’ receipt of a complete  waiver request. Therefore, we proposed

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25623**  

in new paragraph (b) that a waiver    
request is complete when CMS receives  all information necessary for CMS to  make a determination regarding  

approval or denial. We stated that if  CMS determines the waiver request is  not complete, CMS would request  

additional information needed to make  a determination. The 90-day clock  

would start when CMS receives the  complete waiver request. We noted that  we proposed these changes because it is  not possible to make an informed  

decision to approve or deny a request  for a waiver in situations where we do  not have all of the pertinent  

information. We further stated that we  believed this change would reduce the  administrative burden on CMS, as well  

as the POs because, currently, CMS  denies incomplete waiver requests and  POs must resubmit new waiver requests  that include the missing information.  Under the process we proposed, CMS  and the PO would work together to  

ensure that the request includes all    
necessary information, which should  alleviate the need to resubmit a waiver  request.    
We explained in the proposed rule    
that this is similar to the treatment of  PACE applications, and we believed  consistency in review procedures would  be helpful to all parties involved. We  also noted that approval of a waiver  associated with a PACE application is  contingent upon the approval of that  PACE application because there is  

nothing to waive if there is no PACE  program. Accordingly, waivers that are  submitted for review in conjunction  with a PACE application or while a  PACE application is being reviewed  would only be approved if that  

application is approved. As previously  discussed, we proposed to add a new  § 460.28(a)(2) that provides for  

conditional approval for entities with a  pending application to become a PO.  Currently, § 460.28(c)(2) allows CMS  to withdraw its approval of a waiver for  good cause. We proposed to redesignate  this provision as (d)(1) and amend it to  provide that CMS ‘‘in consultation with  the’’ SAA may withdraw approval of a  waiver request for good cause. We  

proposed to add this language because  any significant change to the PACE  

program agreement, which includes  waivers, should be made in consultation  with the SAA because the SAA also is  a signatory of the agreement. We  

proposed in § 460.28(d)(2) that, if the  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
waiver approval is withdrawn, CMS  must notify the PO or PACE applicant  and the SAA that approval of a waiver  has been withdrawn and specify the  reason for withdrawal and the effective  date of the withdrawal in the notice. We  

noted that currently, while the  regulation enables CMS to withdraw an  approval of a waiver request, it does not  require that we notify the PO or PACE  applicant and the SAA of the  

withdrawal, the reason for withdrawal,  or the date when the withdrawal would  be effective. We stated that we believe  this information is critical to the PO or  PACE applicant and the SAA because it  likely would require a change in  operation of the PO or could change  how an applicant would operate a PO if  its application is approved.    
A discussion of the comments we  received on the waiver determination  and notification process, and our  responses to those comments, appears  below.    
*Comment:* Some commenters    
requested that we implement a 30-day  timeframe to determine if a waiver  request is complete and then reduce the  90-day timeframe for review to 60 days.  Commenters also expressed that as CMS  adds additional flexibilities to the PACE  regulations, there may be fewer waiver  requests, and some of the commenters  requested that CMS reduce the 90-day  review period to 60 days.    
*Response:* We appreciate the    
commenters’ suggestions. We note that  if we consider the waiver request we  receive to be complete, the 90-day  review timeframe would have started  upon receipt of that request.  

Consequently, it is in our interest, as  well as the PO’s interest, for us to make  this completeness determination  promptly, and we do not believe it is  necessary to implement a shorter  timeframe for making this  

determination. While we agree with  commenters that we anticipate receiving  fewer waiver requests in the future due  to the additional flexibilities provided  in this final rule, we note that the length  of time we need to review a waiver  request will not be affected by the  number of requests received.    
*Comment:* One commenter described  the process one specific SAA must  undergo in order to effectuate service  area expansions and expansions  involving new PACE centers and  suggested that CMS and the SAA  consider ways to better coordinate and  shorten the timeframes for approval of  PO waivers. The commenter noted that  CMS has 90 days after submission to  complete the review.    
*Response:* Section 903 of BIPA  provides that the Secretary must  approve or deny a waiver request not  later than 90 days after receiving the  request, and that is the timeframe we  established in § 460.28. At this time, we  are not in a position to commit to a  shorter review period than the    
established 90-day review period. While  we seek to review waivers as  

expeditiously as possible, adequate time  must be afforded to review all aspects of  the waiver, including responses to any  requests for additional information.    
After careful consideration of the  comments received, we are finalizing  this proposal without modification.  

*D. Subpart C—PACE Program*    
*Agreement*  

1\. Content and Terms of PACE Program  Agreement (§ 460.32)  

Section 460.32 specifies the required  and optional content of a PACE program  agreement. Under § 460.32(a)(12), a  PACE program agreement must contain  information about the Medicaid  capitation rate and the methodology  used to calculate the Medicare  capitation rate. This requirement is  based on sections 1934(d)(2) and  1894(d)(2) of the Act, which provide  that the Medicaid capitation amount  and the Medicare capitation amount,  respectively, to be applied for a PO for  a contract year must be an amount  specified in the PACE program  agreement for the year.    
Section 460.32(a)(12) and § 460.180(b)  require the PACE program agreement to  specify the methodology used to  calculate the Medicare capitation rate,  as opposed to the actual rate. The PACE  Medicare rate is based on Part A and B  payment rates established for purposes  of payments to Medicare Advantage  organizations and is subject to certain  other adjustments (see § 460.180). For  the Medicaid capitation rate, however,  our current regulations require the  PACE program agreement to specify the  actual amount negotiated between the  POs and the SAA (see § 460.32(a)(12)  and § 460.182(b)).    
As states are moving toward more  managed care delivery systems for the  long term care population, some states  

are redesigning their methodologies for  developing PACE Medicaid capitation  rates to more closely align with these  other managed care delivery systems.  Some of the new methodologies result  in Medicaid payment variations based  on factors such as frailty adjustments  and performance incentive payments.  Additionally, because many states  update their PACE Medicaid capitation  rates annually based on the state fiscal  year, there are operational challenges  associated with updating the PACE  program agreement appendices to reflect  changes to the Medicaid rates because  they are not necessarily updated  consistent with a PACE program  agreement’s contract year. As a result,  we stated in the proposed rule that we  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00015 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**25624 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

believed it is not always practical to  include the actual Medicaid capitation  rates in the PACE program agreement.  Therefore, we proposed to amend  

§ 460.32(a)(12) to require that the    
program agreement include the    
Medicaid capitation rates or Medicaid  payment rate methodology, as well as  the methodology used to calculate the  Medicare capitation rate. Medicaid  

capitation rates are developed and    
updated by the states (in negotiation  with the POs) and approved by CMS.  Operationally, states submit  

documentation to CMS to support their  proposed PACE Medicaid capitation  rates. CMS reviews the documentation  to ensure the rates are in compliance  with the requirements of § 460.182, and  provides the state with written approval  of the rates. The Medicaid capitation  rates are then communicated to the POs  by the state in writing.    
We also solicited comments regarding  other modifications we might make to  the required content of the PACE  

program agreement, specifically, those  cited at § 460.32(a) and § 460.182(d). We  specifically requested comments  

regarding the need for capturing the  level of detail currently required within  the agreement itself, along with updated  information as may be necessary  

throughout the contract period. Much of  the required program agreement content  relates to operational components of the  PO’s program. We explained that our  

expectation is that POs regularly review  and update this information,  

particularly as it relates to policies and  procedures, to ensure its business  

practices are current, compliant with  regulation and guidance, and  

consistently employed. We solicited  comments on whether specific policies  and procedures, and other existing  

requirements, should continue to be  part of the PACE program agreement.  A discussion of the comments we  

received on the PACE program    
agreement requirements, and our    
responses to those comments, appears  below.    
*Comment:* A commenter requested    
that CMS modify the PACE regulations  to allow a PO to enter into a two-way  agreement with CMS to provide services  to Medicare beneficiaries in states that  do not establish PACE as a State option  under Medicaid. In these situations, the  commenter recommended that CMS  require the potential PO to submit the  application with a statement by the state  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
regarding which, if any, of the state  functions the state is willing to perform;  for example, the SRR, nursing home  level of care determination, etc.    
*Response:* We did not propose any    
changes to the current PACE program  

agreement between a PO, CMS and the  SAA for the operation of a PACE  program. Therefore, we consider this  comment to be outside the scope of this  rule. However, we note that in the 1999  IFC and the 2006 final rule, we  articulated, in great detail, requirements  an entity must meet in order to be  approved as a PO and the basis for those  requirements, including the requirement  for a tripartite agreement and rationale  for requiring that POs participate in  both Medicare and Medicaid (64 FR  66237; 71 FR 71251). As we stated in  those rules, the authorizing PACE  statutes (sections 1894 and 1934 of the  Act) envision active collaboration  between federal and state governments  in the administration of the PACE  program. As described in the 1999 IFC  and 2006 final rule, the SAA is  responsible for a wide array of functions  related to the operations of a PACE  program, including: (1) The SRR  conducted as part of activities to  approve an entity as a PO; (2)  

assessment of potential participants to  ensure nursing facility level of care  requirements are satisfied; and (3)  cooperation with CMS in the oversight  of the PACE program (which includes  authority to terminate a PACE program  agreement for cause, as a party to the  tripartite agreement), among other key  activities. As we stated in those rules, it  is our belief that a state which has not  elected PACE as an optional service  would likely be ill-prepared or even  unable to perform these critical  activities. We concluded in those rules  that a Medicare-only program could not  meet the fundamental concept of an all inclusive, integrated, capitated, full-risk  program. Our position today has not  changed; we continue to believe that the  rationale for structuring the PACE  program as we have is valid and  appropriate.    
*Comment:* A number of commenters  expressed support for CMS’ proposal to  modify the current requirement in  § 460.32(a)(12) that the Medicaid  capitation rate be included in the PACE  program agreement. Commenters noted  that the proposed change would allow  for either the Medicaid capitation rate(s)  or the Medicaid payment rate  

methodology to be included in the  PACE program agreement. These  commenters stated that the proposed  approach effectively streamlines  updates to the PACE program  

agreements and provides states the  flexibility to adapt to potential payment  rate changes and variations.    
*Response:* We thank the commenters  for their support.    
*Comment:* One commenter    
recommended that the final rule provide    
clarity on the level of detail expected in  the PACE program agreement for states  that opt to include the Medicaid rate  methodology. The commenter noted  that states already undergo a  

comprehensive review of their PACE  Medicaid rate methodology by CMS  annually. Therefore, commenters  requested that CMS allow a more  general methodology description to be  allowed in the PACE program agreement  to further the flexibility discussed in the  proposed rule and recognize the  extensive methodology review process  already taking place. The commenter  further noted this would avoid the  burden of frequent updates to the PACE  program agreement while leveraging,  rather than duplicating, the  

comprehensive Medicaid rate review  process that CMS already undertakes.  The commenter also requested that CMS  clarify the timeframe in which a state  must update the actual Medicaid  capitation rate in the PACE program  agreement if the state elects to include  the Medicaid rate instead of the  methodology.    
Another commenter noted that the  PACE Medicaid capitation methodology  is complex and often confusing and that  this change removes any incentive for  SAAs to timely ‘‘negotiate’’ the monthly  capitation amount with POs and  produce rate schedules. In addition, the  commenter urged CMS to clarify the  negotiation requirement to establish the  monthly Medicaid capitation amounts.  The commenter indicated that in one  state, Medicaid rates are set using an  actuarial formula, which takes into  account regulatory requirements and the  state’s priorities, which effectively  precludes POs from annually  

negotiating with the SAA. Instead of  focusing on regulatory revisions to  reflect the status quo, the commenter  urged CMS to consider including  language to affirmatively require timely  Medicaid rate setting for the PACE  program and buttress the ability of POs  to negotiate rates.    
*Response:* We are not specifying the  level of detail that the state must  include in the PACE program agreement  to describe the state’s methodology for  Medicaid capitation rates. The state  must provide enough detail about the  Medicaid payment rate methodology to  ensure it is in compliance with  requirements of § 460.182, but the state  will have flexibility in the level of detail  that is provided. In December 2015, we  released guidance to states regarding the  Medicaid rate setting process that  outlines submission and timeframe  expectations related to development and  approval of Medicaid capitation rates  under PACE. The PACE Medicaid

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25625**  

Capitation Rate Setting Guide was    
developed as a resource for states and it  includes critical elements of rate setting  that incorporate both the state  

development of the amount that would  otherwise been paid if individuals were  not enrolled in PACE, and development  

of the PACE rates. The guide can be  found at *https://www.medicaid.gov/  medicaid/ltss/downloads/integrating care/pace-medicaid-capitation-rate setting-guide.pdf.* We expect to update  the guide in the future to provide more  detail and clarification in certain areas  as necessary.    
Additionally, while we do review the  state Medicaid rate documentation to  ensure that the PACE rates meet all  

requirements under § 460.182, including  that the monthly capitation amount is  less than the amount that would  

otherwise have paid under the state  plan if the participants were not  

enrolled under the PACE program, the  state has flexibility in establishing the  rate as long as it meets those  

requirements, which includes the    
flexibility of negotiating with POs. The  process for negotiation of the monthly  capitation payment amount between the  PO and the SAA varies by state. We do  not require a specific process for  

negotiation as long as the rates meet the  requirements of § 460.182(b).    
*Comment:* One commenter    
encouraged CMS to engage with SAAs  to determine which components of the  PACE program agreement are necessary  from the states’ perspective. The  

commenter expressed support for efforts  to remove detailed information that  changes with some frequency, for  

example, administrative contacts that  are available in CMS’ HPMS. It is the  commenter’s expectation that the PACE  program agreement would generally  include high-level requirements as  

opposed to specific program policies  and procedures.    
*Response:* We appreciate the    
thoughtful comments and suggestions  and will consider the feedback provided  as part of possible future rulemaking.    
*Comment:* One commenter noted that  § 460.34 currently states: ‘‘An agreement  is effective for a contract year, but may  be extended for additional contract  

years in the absence of a notice by a  party to terminate.’’ The commenter  recommended this language be modified  as follows: ‘‘An agreement is effective  for a contract year, but *shall* be extended  for additional contract years in the    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
absence of a notice by a party to    
terminate.’’    
*Response:* We did not propose any    
changes to the regulatory provision at  § 460.34 regarding the duration of PACE  program agreements. Therefore, we  

consider this recommendation to be  beyond the scope of this regulation.  However, we may consider this  suggestion as part of possible future  rulemaking. After considering the  comments, we are finalizing the  amendment to § 460.32(a)(12) as  proposed.  

*E. Subpart D—Sanctions, Enforcement  Actions, and Termination*  

1\. Violations for Which CMS May  Impose Sanctions (§ 460.40)  

To support PACE program integrity  and to protect PACE participants, we  proposed to amend provisions related to  enforcement actions we may take when  POs fail to comply with the PACE  program agreement and/or program  requirements. Currently, § 460.50  identifies some causes for CMS or an  SAA to terminate a PACE agreement.  Provisions authorize terminating for  cause in circumstances including, but  not limited to, uncorrected failure to  comply substantially with conditions of  the PACE program or with the terms of  the PACE agreement, and inability to  ensure the health and safety of  participants, such as the presence of  deficiencies that CMS or the SAA  determines cannot be corrected. As we  explained in the proposed rule, while  current regulations reflect CMS and the  SAA’s authority to terminate an  organization in these circumstances, we  believed that we needed to clarify our  authority with respect to alternative  enforcement actions in the form of  sanctions or civil money penalties  (CMPs).    
We proposed adding a new provision  to § 460.40, designated as paragraph (b),  to allow CMS the discretion to take  alternative actions in the form of  sanctions or CMPs when we are  authorized to terminate a PO’s PACE  program agreement. We noted in the  proposed rule that, consistent with the  authorities in sections 1894(e)(6)(B) and  (f)(3) and sections 1934(e)(6)(B) and  (f)(3) of the Act, this new provision  would align the PACE enforcement  structure with the enforcement structure  that applies to the Medicare+Choice  program, renamed, and hereinafter  referred to, as the MA program. The MA  program enforcement authorities in  sections 1857(g)(3) and (4) of the Act  allow CMS the discretion to take  enforcement actions in the form of  sanctions or CMPs when CMS is  authorized to terminate the  

organization’s contract. We proposed  that this approach also be utilized in the  PACE program, consistent with our  statutory authority identified in sections  1894(e)(6)(B) and 1934(e)(6)(B) of the    
Act, and to promote consistency with  the enforcement structure of the MA  program. We stated that the change  would give CMS the discretion to  impose sanctions and CMPs on POs for  continued noncompliance, in addition  to our current authority to take the most  extreme action of termination of the  PACE program agreement. To add  paragraph (b), we proposed to  

redesignate the introductory language in  § 460.40 to paragraph (a) and  

redesignate paragraphs (a) through (i) to  paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(9).  

2\. Civil Money Penalties (§ 460.46)  

Due to the redesignation of    
paragraphs in § 460.40, we also  proposed to make technical, non substantive changes to the citations in  this section to reflect the substantive  and technical changes discussed above.  Specifically, we proposed to amend  § 460.46(a)(1) by removing the reference  ‘‘§ 460.40(c) or (d)’’ and adding in its  place the reference ‘‘§ 460.40(a)(3) or  (4)’’. We proposed to amend  

§ 460.46(a)(2) by removing the reference  ‘‘§ 460.40(e)’’ and adding in its place the  reference ‘‘§ 460.40(a)(5)’’. We also  proposed to amend § 460.46(a)(3) by  removing the reference ‘‘§ 460.40(f)(1)’’  and adding in its place the reference  ‘‘§ 460.40(a)(6)(i)’’. These changes reflect  the new numbering of § 460.40 that was  discussed previously.    
Additionally, we proposed to revise  § 460.46(a), in accordance with the  Federal Civil Penalties Inflation  Adjustment Act Improvements Act of  2015 (the 2015 Act) (Sec. 701 of Pub. L.  114–74). The 2015 Act requires agencies  to adjust the civil money penalties  annually for inflation. The Department  of Health and Human Services will  publish all of the Department’s adjusted  CMP amounts at 45 CFR part 102\. To  ensure transparency, we proposed  revising § 460.46(a) to state that the  penalty amounts are adjusted for  inflation and citing to 42 CFR 1003.102.    
The following is a summary of the  public comments we received on the  proposed provisions regarding  sanctions, enforcement actions, and  termination, and our responses to  comments.    
*Comment:* Commenters were    
supportive of our proposed revisions. A  few commenters mentioned that  allowing sanctions or CMPs to be taken  prior to termination would help POs  have time to correct identified issues of  noncompliance. Other commenters,  while supportive, cautioned CMS to  consider the size and financial stability  of POs prior to implementing a sanction  or CMP, stating that a large CMP or  enforcement action could effectively

drive a PO out of business. One    
commenter recommended that CMS  perform a risk benefit analysis prior to  implementing a sanction or CMP to  ensure the benefit outweighed the  

potential risk.    
*Response:* We agree with these    
commenters that revising the    
regulations to enable us to take    
enforcement actions other than    
termination will be beneficial to POs by  allowing them time to correct  

deficiencies. We appreciate commenters  concerns regarding the potential adverse  impact of CMPs and sanctions on POs.  We intend to use the new range of  

penalties in a manner that appropriately  accounts for the size and structure of the  PO subject to the enforcement action.  *Comment:* A few commenters  

referenced SAAs. One commenter    
requested clarification on how the SAA  and CMS would work cooperatively on  enforcement actions, and if the SAA  would be informed prior to a sanction  being placed on a PO. Another  

commenter requested that CMS modify  the regulatory language in § 460.40(b) to  say that either CMS or the SAA may  take a sanction or CMP. The same  

commenter requested that any money  collected from a CMP be split evenly  between CMS and the state. Lastly, one  commenter requested that we add a new  paragraph (c) to the regulation that  

discusses a state’s authority to take    
enforcement actions based on State laws  and regulations.    
*Response:* We are committed to    
maintaining a close partnership with  SAAs in overseeing POs. When taking  enforcement actions, we will notify the  SAA prior to taking the action, as  

appropriate. However, we are not    
modifying the regulatory language in the  new § 460.40(b) to address SAAs’ ability  to take sanctions or CMPs. This  

regulatory language is aligned with    
sections 1894(e)(6)(B) and 1934(e)(6)(B)  of the Act, which do not address the  state’s ability to take an enforcement  action or require consultation with the  SAA before imposing sanctions or  

CMPs, and we believe that we should  keep the language similar in this  

regulation. We are also not accepting the  suggestion to add a new paragraph into  the regulation to address a state’s ability  to use state laws and regulations to take  its own enforcement actions. We do not  believe this level of detail is needed, as  nothing in this regulation would  

prevent a state from using its own legal  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
authority to impose a state enforcement  action on a PO. However, we encourage  states to coordinate with us prior to  taking any enforcement actions against  POs based on state authority. Also,  

while we appreciate the commenter’s  

request that we split CMP money  between the states and CMS, we are not  authorized to dictate where that money  goes, and cannot make that change.    
*Comment:* A few commenters, while  supportive of the proposed modification  to our enforcement provisions, stressed  the importance of consistency in audits,  especially if audit findings are used in  enforcement actions against POs. One  commenter questioned what the  reference to ‘‘continued non 

compliance’’ meant, and whether that  could mean repeat audit findings.  *Response:* In the proposed rule, we  discussed the regulations regarding  termination of a PACE program  agreement, and that one of the reasons  for termination was ‘‘continued non compliance’’ which is discussed in 42  CFR 460.50(b). In the proposed rule, we  noted that our proposed expansion to  our enforcement authority would allow  us to take other enforcement actions,  outside of termination, for continued  non-compliance. We define continued  non-compliance as any instance in  which a PO has been made aware it is  not in compliance with a regulation or  requirement, and the PO has failed to  correct that issue within a reasonable  period of time, or has repeated  uncorrected deficiencies. What will  constitute a reasonable period of time  for correction may depend on the  severity of non-compliance noted by  CMS or the SAA. We want to clarify that  while continued non-compliance may  be identified through repeat audit  findings, audits would not be the only  source of information to inform an  enforcement action. Although continued  non-compliance could be revealed  through audits, it could also be  discovered through routine account  management monitoring, quality  reporting, or any other avenue in which  CMS or the SAA discovers these issues.  However, audits are one of the ways we  would measure continued non compliance and we agree that audit  consistency is very important. We  continue to make process improvements  to PACE audits, including utilizing a  revised audit protocol, continuing to  refine and update internal auditor tools,  utilizing a national audit consistency  team, and implementing intensive  auditor training specific to PACE.  After considering public comments,  we are finalizing the changes to  §§ 460.40 and 460.46 as originally  proposed with the following technical  changes. First, in § 460.46, we are  making a technical change to the  citation in the proposed note from 45  CFR 1003.102 to 45 CFR part 102, and  including the language regarding  inflation in the regulatory text and not    
as a note as originally proposed.  Second, in § 460.40, we are  

redesignating paragraph (j) that was  established in the November 15, 2016  **Federal Register** (81 FR 80561\) as part  of the final rule entitled, ‘‘Medicare  Program; Revisions to Payment Policies  under the Physician Fee Schedule and  Other Revisions to Part B for CY 2017;  Medicare Advantage Bid Pricing Data  Release; Medicare Advantage and Part D  Medical Loss Ratio Data Release;  Medicare Advantage Provider Network  Requirements; Expansion of Medicare  Diabetes Prevention Program Model;  Medicare Shared Savings Program  Requirements’’ and later modified in the  April 16, 2018 final rule entitled  ‘‘Medicare Program; Contract Year 2019  Policy and Technical Changes to the  Medicare Advantage, Medicare Cost  Plan, Medicare Fee for Service, the  Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit  Programs and the PACE Program’’ (83  FR 16756), as paragraph (a)(10). Finally,  we note that the proposed regulation  text for § 460.40(a)(3) included language  concerning the criteria for sanctions  even though our intention was solely to  redesignate the paragraph. Therefore,  we are modifying the final rule to  remove the language regarding  discrimination on the basis of an  individual’s functional, cognitive or  psychosocial status, which was  inadvertently included, redesignate the  paragraph, and restore the language that  refers to discrimination in enrollment or  disenrollment among Medicare  beneficiaries or Medicaid beneficiaries,  or both, who are eligible to enroll in a  PACE program, on the basis of an  individual’s health status or need for  health care services.  

*F. Subpart E—PACE Administrative  Requirements*  

1\. PACE Organizational Structure  (§ 460.60)  

Sections 1894(a)(3)(A)(i) and    
1934(a)(3)(A)(i) of the Act require a PO  to be (or be a distinct part of) a public  entity or a private, nonprofit entity  organized for charitable purposes under  section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1986\. We implemented these  provisions in § 460.60(a), which  provides that a PO must be, or be a  distinct part of, either (1) an entity of  city, county, state, or Tribal government  or (2) a private, not-for-profit entity  organized for charitable purposes under  section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1986, and it may be a  

corporation, a subsidiary of a larger  corporation, or a department of a  corporation. In this discussion, we will

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25627**  

refer to all entities that meet this    
standard as not-for-profit entities.  

Sections 1894(h) and 1934(h) of the  Act direct the Secretary to waive the  requirement that a PO be a not-for-profit  entity in order to demonstrate the  

operation of a PO by private, for-profit  entities. Section 4804(b) of the BBA of  1997 requires the Secretary to provide a  report to Congress on the impact of the  demonstration on quality and cost of  services, including certain findings  

regarding the frailty level, access to care,  and the quality of care of PACE  

participants enrolled with for-profit  POs, as compared to not-for-profit POs.  Section 4804(b)(2) of the BBA of 1997  requires the report to Congress to  

include findings on whether any of the  following four statements is true with  respect to the for-profit PACE  

demonstration:  

• The number of covered lives    
enrolled with entities operating under  demonstration project waivers under  sections 1894(h) and 1934(h) of the Act  is fewer than 800 (or such lesser number  as the Secretary may find statistically  sufficient to make determinations  

respecting findings described in the  succeeding subparagraphs).  

• The population enrolled with such  entities is less frail than the population  enrolled with other POs.  

• Access to or quality of care for    
individuals enrolled with such entities  is lower than such access or quality for  individuals enrolled with other POs.  

• The application of such section has  resulted in an increase in expenditures  under the Medicare or Medicaid  

programs above the expenditures that  would have been made if such section  did not apply. (We refer to these  

statements collectively as the BBA    
statements.)  

Under sections 1894(a)(3)(B)(ii) and  1934(a)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act, after the date  the report is submitted to Congress, the  requirement that a PO be a not-for-profit  entity will not apply unless the  

Secretary determines that any of the  BBA statements are true.  

In 2008, Mathematica Policy Research  completed a study of the permanent not for-profit POs.5 An interim report to  Congress based on this study was  

submitted in January 2009\. At the time  of the 2008 Mathematica study, no for profit entities had enrolled in the PACE  demonstration. Therefore, neither report    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
assessed a for-profit PACE population  

5A copy of the 2008 Mathematica study results  can be found here: *http://www.cms.gov/Research Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and Reports/Reports/Downloads/Beauchamp*\_*2008.pdf.*  

nor did the interim report address the  BBA statements.  

From 2012 to 2013, Mathematica,  under contract with CMS, conducted a  study to address quality of and access to  care for participants of for-profit POs,  specifically focusing on the third BBA  statement. The 2013 Mathematica report  also included information that provided  insight into the first and second BBA  statements.6 Based on the two  

Mathematica studies, HHS prepared and  submitted the report to the Congress on  May 19, 2015\. A copy of the report to  Congress is available at *https:// innovation.cms.gov/Files/reports/RTC*\_ *For-Profit*\_*PACE*\_*Report*\_*to*\_*Congress*\_ *051915*\_*Clean.pdf.*  

As detailed in the report, HHS could  not conclude that any of the four BBA  statements were true. First, the number  of covered lives enrolled with for-profit  POs was not fewer than 800, and the  sample size for the survey examining  BBA statements two and three was large  enough to make statistically significant  determinations of differences. The  report stated that HHS could not  conclude that for-profit PACE  

participants are less frail than not-for profit PACE participants. It also stated  that HHS could not conclude that for profit PACE participants experienced  systematic adverse differences in quality  of care or access to care as compared to  not-for-profit PACE participants.  Finally, expenditures were equal  between for-profit and not-for-profit POs  after controlling for beneficiary risk  score, organization frailty score, and  county rates, so there would not have  been an increase in expenditures if  participants in the for-profit POs had  been enrolled with a not-for-profit PO.  

Based on the findings in the report to  Congress, we determined that under  sections 1894(a)(3)(B) and 1934(a)(3)(B)  of the Act, the requirement that a PO be  a not-for profit entity would no longer  apply after May 19, 2015 (the  

submission date of the report to  Congress). Because the statutory not-for profit restriction no longer applies, in  the proposed rule, we proposed to  remove the corresponding restriction in  § 460.60(a) in its entirety. We also  proposed to redesignate § 460.60(b), (c),  and (d) as § 460.60(a), (b), and (c),  respectively.  

A discussion of the comments we  received on the proposal to remove the  not-for-profit restriction in § 460.60(a),  and our responses to those comments,  appears below.  

6A copy of the 2013 Mathematica study results  can be found here: *https://innovation.cms.gov/  Files/reports/pace-access-qualityreport.pdf.*    
*Comment:* Commenters expressed  concerns about CMS allowing for-profit  entities to be POs. Many commenters  believed that although the evaluation of  the for-profit PACE demonstration  found no significant reasons to restrict  PACE to not-for-profit entities, CMS  should continue its evaluation to  identify and better understand any  potential differences driven by  ownership by a for-profit entity and to  ensure that regulatory oversight is  applied uniformly to all POs as it  pertains to service utilization,  

participant frailty and outcomes and  costs and experience. Other commenters  recommended CMS consider requiring  all for-profit POs to meet a ratio of  services to revenues, similar to the  medical loss ratio requirements set forth  in the final rule published in the May  6, 2016 **Federal Register** (81 FR 27498\)  entitled, ‘‘Medicaid and Children’s  Health Insurance Program (CHIP)  Programs; Medicaid Managed Care,  CHIP Delivered in Managed Care, and  Revisions Related to Third Party  Liability.’’ One commenter  

recommended CMS consider continuing  its evaluation for up to 3 years for the  for-profit POs. Another commenter  supported the change to allow for-profit  entities to be POs.    
*Response:* As a result of the findings  in the May 19, 2015 report to Congress,  sections 1894(a)(3)(B) and 1934(a)(3)(B)  of the Act state that the requirement that  a PO be a not-for-profit entity will no  longer apply. The findings of the report  did not suggest that we establish  different requirements for POs based on  their profit status, and we see no basis  for applying a different set of  

requirements, such as medical loss ratio  requirements, to for-profit POs.  Consequently, the PACE regulations and  requirements apply equally to all POs  whether they are not-for-profit or for profit. We have no reason to believe that  the results of the evaluation would  change if we added additional years to  the study. We note that the majority of  active POs are not-for-profit entities and  most new applicants represent not-for profit entities.    
As a result of the comments, we are  making no changes to our proposal and  finalizing this provision as proposed.    
In addition, we proposed to revise  current paragraph (d)(3) (redesignated  paragraph (c)(3)) regarding changes in  

the organizational structure of a PO and  add a new paragraph (d) to address PO  change of ownership (CHOW). Section  460.60(d)(3) currently provides that a  PO planning a change in organizational  structure must notify CMS and the SAA,  in writing, at least 14 days before the  change takes effect. We have stated in  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**25628 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

guidance that a change in organizational  structure is one that may affect the  

philosophy, mission, and operations of  the PO and affect care delivery to  

participants, and would include any  CHOW (see PACE Manual, Ch. 2,  

§ 20.3).    
In the 1999 IFC (64 FR 66241), we    
required POs to notify both CMS and  the SAA at least 60 days prior to any  change in their organizational structure  and obtain advance approval for any  change that involved a CHOW. In the  2006 final rule (71 FR 71264), we  

discussed the comments we received on  this provision and explained it was not  our intent to require POs to notify CMS  and the SAA in writing every time there  was a change in personnel or a change  in the line of reporting of direct  

participant care staff. Based on    
comments that the 60-day timeframe  was unnecessary, we elected to change  the requirement to the 14-day  

requirement that is currently in place.  We also deleted the requirement that  changes in organizational structure must  be approved in advance by CMS and the  SAA, agreeing with commenters that  POs have the ability to make such  

business decisions based on their    
individual circumstances. As CMS and  the SAA are responsible for the health  care provided to participants, we  

retained the 14-day notification    
requirement in § 460.60(d)(3) to allow  CMS and the SAA sufficient time to  monitor whether the change is having a  substantial impact on the participants or  their care. However, we reiterated that  in the event of a CHOW, we would  

apply the general provisions described  in the Medicare Advantage regulations  at § 422.550.    
Based on our experiences with PO    
CHOW since we published the 2006  final rule, we stated in the proposed  rule that we no longer believed 14 days  gives us enough time to review and  process a CHOW. A CHOW is  

significantly different from other    
organizational changes in that it results  in the acquiring entity assuming the  responsibilities under the PACE  

program agreement. We explained we  need additional time to determine  

whether the acquiring entity meets    
statutory and regulatory requirements  for entering into a PACE program  

agreement. We noted that our ultimate  responsibility is to the PACE  

participants, and we need to ensure that  an entity is able to assume and fulfill  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
the responsibilities of a PO under the  PACE program agreement.    
Moreover, we noted that the process  to effectuate a CHOW transaction in our  systems requires more time than the 14-  day timeframe in the current regulation.  

For example, a minimum of 6 weeks is  needed to effectuate changes in our  payment systems for the new owner. A  60-day advance notification requirement  is more consistent with that timing. We  also stated that we wanted our  regulations to be clear that the  

requirements in 42 CFR part 422,  subpart L (Effect of Change of  

Ownership or Leasing of Facilities  During Term of Contract), which apply  to MAOs under the Medicare Advantage  program, apply to POs in a CHOW  scenario. Therefore, we proposed to  amend newly redesignated paragraph  (c)(3) to indicate that the 14-day  timeframe does not apply to a CHOW,  and to add new paragraph (d), which  would specify that a PO planning a  CHOW must comply with all  

requirements in 42 CFR part 422,  subpart L, and must notify CMS and the  SAA, in writing, at least 60 days before  the anticipated effective date of the  change. We stated that we believed this  proposed change would provide the  time we need to determine if the entity  acquiring the PO meets all PACE  requirements and would be able to  continue providing quality care to the  participants of the PO, and to reflect the  change in our systems. We also noted  that we believed the amended language  as proposed would provide greater  clarity to POs as to the requirements  that will apply in CHOW scenarios. We  stated that we believed the Medicare  Advantage requirements for a CHOW in  42 CFR part 422 subpart L, are  

appropriate for the PACE program, and  we will only enter into a PACE program  agreement with an entity that is  determined to meet PACE program  requirements.    
For purposes of the proposed    
provision, any CHOW as defined in  § 422.550(a), such as an asset transfer, a  merger, or change in partnership, would  require a novation agreement, where the  contract is substituted for the former  contract. We explained that POs will  need to follow all CHOW requirements  in 42 CFR part 422, subpart L, and must  submit all of the necessary documents  to CMS for review within the allotted  timeframes. Upon CMS’ determination  that the conditions for CMS approval of  a novation agreement are met, a new  PACE program agreement will be  executed with the acquiring entity.    
A discussion of the comments we  received on the CHOW proposal, and  our responses to those comments,  appears below.    
*Comment:* A few commenters stated  the definition of a CHOW may  

encompass situations where the PO’s  parent entity or supporting entity  undergoes a restructuring which has no    
impact on the PO itself. They also  questioned if the 60-day notice and  related requirements would apply in a  restructuring of the PO’s parent entity.  The commenter suggested that, in these  types of situations, the PO should not  have to submit advance notice and  comply with the requirements of 42 CFR  part 422, subpart L.    
*Response:* POs may contact us if they  have questions on the applicable  requirements and whether a particular  scenario is a CHOW or a different type  of change in organizational structure. If  a PO is planning a CHOW as described  in § 460.60(d) then the PO must follow  the regulations at § 460.60(d) and  provide the required notification.    
*Comment:* A commenter requested  that CMS clarify if the novation  agreement is similar to the PACE  program agreement.    
*Response:* The novation agreement  and PACE program agreement are two  separate and distinct documents. The  novation agreement is an agreement  between the current owner of the PO,  the prospective new owner, and us  under which we recognize the new  owner as the successor in interest to the  current owner’s PACE program  agreement. The PACE program  agreement will be the successor’s PACE  program agreement with CMS and the  SAA for the operation of a PACE  program by the successor PO.    
*Comment:* Many commenters    
supported the proposal to expand the  notification timeframe for a CHOW from  14 days to 60 days. One commenter  requested that we consider the SAA’s  needs for advance notification for  CHOW scenarios and add additional  time to our requirement for notification.    
*Response:* We work closely with the  SAA as the third party to the PACE  program agreement. We expect that as  POs are seeking to undergo CHOW  transactions that they communicate  with the SAA prior to or at the same  time as they communicate with us. We  will consider the recommendation to  allow for additional time to notify the  SAA as part of future rulemaking or  guidance.    
*Comment:* A commenter requested  that we limit the requirement for an  entity to complete a PACE application  for purposes of a CHOW as discussed in  the HPMS PACE CHOW memo,  Guidance on Notification Requirements  for PACE Organization Change of  Ownership, dated February 18, 2016, to  apply only to those entities that have no  experience with PACE program  operations. Another commenter  suggested that the successor in interest  to the PACE CHOW should not have to  go through the PACE application

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25629**  

process, but did not suggest an    
alternative for the qualification process.  *Response:* We want to reiterate our  

policy that in order for an acquiring  entity to become qualified as a PO, the  entity must follow both the CMS and  the specific state’s PACE application  submission process. The application  process provides a level of assurance to  us, as well as the SAA, that the  

successor in interest to the PO has the  ability to assume the obligation to  

provide care to the vulnerable    
population in PACE.    
*Comment:* One commenter expressed  concern that if a PO is seeking a CHOW  due to a financial hardship or  

experiencing other difficulties, requiring  the acquiring entity to become qualified  through the PACE application process  may make it impossible to prevent  

actions such as a PACE termination.  *Response:* We appreciate the  

comment and will continue to work  with POs that are in these types of  

hardship situations to help ensure that  their participants continue to receive  proper care. Even though we have  

designated timeframes to complete the  application approval process, when we  are made aware of these types of  

extenuating circumstances, we work  closely with the PO and the SAA to  process the application as quickly as  possible and prevent negative impact to  the participants.    
We appreciate the commenters’    
recommendations and will consider  them as we develop subregulatory  

guidance on PO CHOWs. We will    
continue to require all entities that are  not currently approved POs, but would  like to be the successor in interest to a  PO, to become qualified as a PO through  our PACE application process. The  

PACE application process is an    
administrative process with established  requirements that all entities have to  meet in order to qualify as a PO. This  application process demonstrates to us  and the SAA that the successor in  

interest to the PO is qualified to be a PO  and will maintain arrangements to  

comply with the legal and regulatory  requirements for PACE and other  

requirements imposed under the PACE  program agreement. This allows us to  maintain a consistent qualification  

process for all entities. We are finalizing  the CHOW requirements as proposed.  

2\. Governing Body (§ 460.62)  

Section 460.62 focuses on the ability  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
of the PO’s governing body to provide  effective administration in an outcome oriented environment. As we have  

previously explained in the 1999 IFC  (64 FR 66241\) and the 2006 final rule  (71 FR 71264), the governing body  

guides operations and promotes and  protects participant health and safety,  and it is legally and fiscally responsible  for the administration of the PO.  Additionally, the governing body must  create and foster an environment that  provides quality care that is consistent  with participant needs and the program  mission. To that end, we proposed to  revise the language in § 460.62(a)(7) and  to add new paragraph (a)(8). Currently,  § 460.62(a)(7) references a ‘‘quality  assessment and performance  

improvement’’ program. In addition to  replacing that term with ‘‘quality  improvement,’’ as discussed in section  II.A. of this final rule, we also proposed  to add a reference to the quality  improvement program requirements in  § 460.130, to make it clear that the  governing body is ultimately  

responsible for ensuring the PO meets  those requirements.    
As we did not receive any comments  on these proposed changes, we are  finalizing this provision as proposed.    
In addition, as discussed later in this  section, we proposed in a new § 460.63  to require that all POs adopt and  implement effective compliance  oversight. Because the governing body is  both legally and fiscally responsible for  administration of the PO, and is  responsible for ensuring that the  organization provides quality care (see  § 460.62(a)), we stated that we believed  adoption and implementation of  compliance oversight requirements is  the responsibility of the governing body.  We noted that having legal  

responsibility over the governance of  the organization requires ensuring that  the organization complies with federal  and state regulations, adheres to  contract requirements, and minimizes  waste and abuse. To that end, we  proposed to add a new § 460.62(a)(8)  that specifies the governing body of the  PO must have full legal authority and  responsibility for adopting and  implementing effective compliance  oversight as described in § 460.63.  As discussed in detail in the  

following section, we received several  comments on our compliance oversight  proposal and as a result of those  comments, we have decided not to  finalize certain aspects of that proposal  at this time, in order to allow CMS  additional time to evaluate the potential  burden that implementing certain  aspects of the compliance oversight  provision might have on POs. Relatedly,  based on these comments and to allow  additional time to evaluate the potential  burden, we are not finalizing the  proposal to add a new § 460.62(a)(8)  specifying that the governing body of  the PO must have full legal authority    
and responsibility for adopting and  implementing the compliance oversight  program.  

3\. Compliance Oversight Requirements  (§ 460.63)  

In the proposed rule, we discussed  the compliance programs required  under the Medicare Advantage (MA)  and Medicare Part D programs, and  noted that those programs have long  been recognized as key to protecting  against fraud, waste, and abuse. The  importance of these programs has been  highlighted by several of our oversight  bodies. As is authorized by sections  1934(f)(3) and 1894(f)(3) of the Act, we  proposed to adopt compliance oversight  requirements in the PACE regulations.  Specifically, at new § 460.63, entitled  ‘‘Compliance Oversight Requirements,’’  we proposed to require each PO to have  a compliance oversight program that is  responsible for monitoring and auditing  their organization for compliance with  our regulations. Additionally, we  proposed to require POs to have  measures that prevent, detect and  correct non-compliance with CMS’  program requirements, as well as  measures that prevent, detect, and  correct fraud, waste, and abuse.    
In determining what compliance  oversight CMS should require of all  POs, we considered as potential models  the compliance program requirements  for Medicare Part C organizations at  § 422.503(b)(4)(vi) and the compliance  program requirements for Part D  sponsors at § 423.504(b)(4)(vi). POs  offering qualified prescription drug  coverage under Part D are already  required to have a compliance program  as a part of their Part D benefit,  however, specific requirements of the  Part D compliance program were waived  for all POs. The Part D application took  into account PACE as a direct care  provider, as well as a payer, and it  weighed the importance of maintaining  compliance with CMS regulations with  the need for flexibility as a direct care  provider. All Part D compliance  program elements were waived except  the two elements that we proposed.    
In § 460.63, we proposed to establish  that the two elements of a Part D  compliance program required of POs  participating in Part D will become  compliance oversight requirements for  the PO as a whole. Specifically, we  proposed to require each PO to adopt  and implement effective compliance  oversight, which includes measures that  prevent, detect and correct non compliance with CMS’ program  requirements, as well as measures that  prevent, detect and correct fraud, waste  and abuse that would include, at a

**25630 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

minimum: (1) The establishment and  implementation of an effective system  for routine monitoring and  

identification of compliance risks,    
which should include internal    
monitoring and audits and, as    
appropriate, external audits, to evaluate  the PO, including contractors,  

compliance with CMS requirements and  the overall effectiveness of the  

compliance oversight program; and (2)  the establishment and implementation  of procedures and a system for promptly  responding to compliance issues as they  are raised, investigating potential  

compliance problems as identified in  the course of self-evaluations and  

audits, correcting such problems    
promptly and thoroughly to reduce the  potential for recurrence, and ensuring  ongoing compliance with our  

requirements. As part of the system for  promptly responding to compliance  issues, we also proposed the  

requirements that a PO: (1) Conduct a  timely, reasonable inquiry if it discovers  evidence of misconduct related to  

payment or delivery of items or services,  (2) conduct appropriate corrective  

actions in response to the potential    
violation (for example, repayment of  overpayments or disciplinary actions  against responsible employees), and (3)  have procedures to voluntarily self 

report potential fraud or misconduct to  CMS and the SAA. We noted that the  PO should already have these elements  implemented for their Part D benefit to  comply with the Part D regulations, but  they would need to expand these efforts  to cover all of the services provided by  the PO.    
As we explained in the proposed rule,  POs are not currently required to  

conduct internal organization wide    
monitoring or auditing efforts. Through  our experiences with MA and Part D  organizations, we stated that we  

believed conducting monitoring and  auditing is key to identifying and  

correcting issues of non-compliance  with CMS requirements. We noted that  we believed that by adding these two  compliance oversight provisions we are  balancing the duty of a PO to ensure  compliance with CMS requirements  with the need for flexibility as a  

provider of service. We stated that POs  will also benefit from improving their  ability to identify and correct  

compliance risks within their own    
organization.    
Additionally, we proposed to require  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
the PO to implement appropriate    
corrective action in response to any  identified issues of non-compliance that  POs may discover. We noted that, if  finalized, we intended to verify  

compliance with this new requirement  

through monitoring or auditing of the  PO.  

We received public comments from  POs, states and advocacy groups which  were supportive of the effort to ensure  appropriate protections are in place, but  cautioned CMS about the potential  burden associated with implementing  these provisions. We analyzed our  proposal and believe that the majority of  the burden on POs associated with the  proposed compliance oversight  requirements is due to the first proposed  element, the requirement that a PO  develop and implement a system for  monitoring and auditing their PACE  operations. While we consider it a best  practice for a PO to adopt a compliance  program that includes conducting  internal monitoring and auditing, we are  not finalizing our proposal to require  the PO to adopt a system for routine  monitoring and auditing of the PO and  its contractors at this time in order to  further evaluate the potential burden of  this proposal on smaller organizations.  As Part D plan sponsors, POs must still  conduct monitoring and auditing of  their Part D benefit as required under 42  CFR 423.504(b)(4)(vi)(F). The second  proposed element of the compliance  oversight requirements, which requires  promptly responding to non-compliance  and voluntary reporting of identified  issues, does not pose a significant  burden on a PO. Therefore, we are  finalizing the second element of this  provision which would require POs to  correct identified non-compliance and  voluntarily report fraud and/or potential  misconduct to CMS and the SAA. In  large part, POs may utilize their already  established Part D system to comply  with these new requirements for  responding to, correcting and reporting  non-compliance and potential fraud,  and because we are not increasing the  scope of a PO’s monitoring  

responsibilities, we anticipate only a  minimal burden on the organization by  implementing this modified provision.  

The following is a summary of the  public comments we received on the  proposed compliance oversight  requirements in new § 460.63 and our  responses to comments. As a result of  these comments, we are finalizing this  provision in part.  

*Comment:* A majority of commenters  were supportive of our proposal to  require POs to adopt a compliance  oversight program. Commenters noted  that adding compliance oversight  requirements is an important step to  ensuring POs are able to stop non compliance and take appropriate  corrective action. These commenters  noted that this proposal would help    
ensure the safety of participants, and  protect against fraud, waste and abuse.  *Response:* We appreciate commenters’  support and agree that implementing a  compliance oversight program is a best  practice for all organizations, big or  small, in order to ensure compliance  with federal and state regulations. We  hope that POs will consider increasing  the scope of their monitoring and  auditing efforts as part of their effort to  ensure they are compliant with our  requirements. We are not, however,  finalizing the first element of our  proposal which would have required  POs to expand the scope of their  monitoring efforts. Instead, we are only  finalizing the second element, which  requires POs to respond, investigate and  correct non-compliance as it is  identified. While we further evaluate  the implications of a required  

compliance oversight program on the  unique PACE model of care, we will  continue to assess potential risk to  participant safety through auditing and  account management oversight, and  address any identified fraud, waste and  abuse issues as needed.    
*Comment:* Multiple commenters  raised concerns over the potential  burden that implementing this  provision would cause POs.  

Commenters stated that there are  significant differences between MA/Part  D organizations and POs; including the  fact that MA/Part D organizations tend  to have larger staffs and greater  resources, as well as different program  structures, which would make  

implementing this proposal more  challenging for POs. Other commenters  suggested that the burden on smaller  organizations and rural organizations  would be especially significant. Most  commenters also requested that, if CMS  finalizes this provision, that the  implementation date be no earlier than  12 months following the regulation  becoming final in order to allow  organizations the appropriate time to  determine how to appropriately  implement a compliance oversight  program and allocate resources. Several  commenters suggested that CMS had  underestimated the cost of  

implementing a compliance oversight  program in PACE. One commenter  requested that CMS work closely with  stakeholders to determine technical  assistance needs and practical  

implementation schedules before  enacting this proposal.    
*Response:* We appreciate commenters’  concerns regarding the potential burden  this provision may cause for POs. We  have a significant policy interest in  further assessing how to integrate an  effective compliance oversight program,

as well as the potential burden and    
benefits related to expanding this    
provision across the PACE program. In  order to minimize the potential burden  associated with this provision, we re analyzed the burden estimates and  

believe that the majority of costs are  associated with the first element of our  proposal, the element that would  

require POs to expand their auditing  and monitoring efforts to cover their  entire operation. While we consider it a  best practice to conduct internal  

auditing and monitoring to identify non compliance with PACE requirements,  we are not finalizing that element of this  provision at this time while we further  evaluate the implications of this  

proposal on the unique PACE model of  care. We are, however, finalizing the  second element which would largely  allow organizations to use their already  established system to respond to and  correct any non-compliance discovered  in the POs. We anticipate only a  

minimal burden in finalizing this    
element and believe such efforts can be  implemented in the 60 days following  publication of the final rule.    
*Comment:* Several commenters posed  questions regarding the structure or  administration of a compliance  

oversight program in PACE. Two    
commenters questioned if POs would be  required to submit their compliance  oversight program to CMS for approval.  The same two commenters questioned if  CMS would require the POs to  

implement specific structures, policies  or procedures for the compliance  

oversight program. Another commenter  questioned if CMS would offer technical  assistance to POs.    
*Response:* We appreciate the    
opportunity to provide clarification on  this proposal. We understand that POs  are both payers, as well as direct care  providers. We also understand that POs  vary greatly in size, structure and  

resources. As such, we believe that a PO  should continue to be free to develop a  compliance oversight program that  

works best for their specific    
organization. POs are already required  to have systems in place to correct  

identified non-compliance and    
voluntarily report fraud or potential  misconduct to us for their Part D  

benefit, and we do not anticipate that  substantial changes would need to be  made to the structure of such systems  based on this provision as finalized.  

Additionally, while we would be    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
willing to provide technical guidance to  POs, we do not expect to collect  

documentation regarding the structure  of a PO’s compliance oversight program  or provide an approval process. Instead,  POs will have flexibility in designing  

their own compliance oversight  programs so long as they ensure they are  satisfying the requirements in the new  § 460.63.    
*Comment:* A few commenters    
questioned how CMS would monitor  these compliance oversight programs in  PACE. One commenter suggested CMS  conduct rigorous monitoring of the  compliance oversight programs.  Another commenter questioned if CMS  would validate the monitoring that POs  did under their compliance oversight  programs. One commenter requested  that CMS ensure that any monitoring of  the compliance oversight program is  done consistently across regions.    
*Response:* We may begin monitoring  compliance with the requirements in  § 460.63 as finalized during audits or  other communications with POs. We  agree that CMS monitoring should be  done consistently and we intend to  develop specific guidance for auditors  or other personnel in CMS.    
*Comment:* Several commenters  expressed their support for our proposal  to reduce the frequency of CMS audits  and characterized it as being in  exchange for requiring POs to develop  their own compliance oversight  requirements.    
*Response:* We thank the commenters  for their support. While we proposed  both to decrease the frequency of our  audits and to increase POs’ self monitoring, these policies were each  intended to stand on its own and were  not intended to be an exchange. While  we are not finalizing the element of the  proposed compliance oversight  requirements that would have required  POs to monitor and audit all operations,  we believe that this is a best practice  and would encourage organizations to  expand the scope of their current  monitoring and auditing efforts. We are  finalizing the second element within  this provision in order to ensure POs are  promptly responding to, investigating  and correcting potential compliance  problems as they are identified.  Separately, we are also finalizing our  proposal to reduce the frequency of  reviews by us in cooperation with the  SAA under § 460.192, as discussed in  the final rule below in Subpart K—  Federal/State Monitoring.    
*Comment:* One commenter    
recommended that the compliance  oversight requirements for POs include  all seven elements of the MA and Part  D compliance programs, rather than just  the two we proposed.    
*Response:* We thank this commenter  for the suggestion. While we believe that  compliance programs are beneficial to  all organizations, regardless of size, we  decided at this time not to require POs    
to implement the seven compliance  program elements required under MA  and Part D. Under the Part D  

regulations, POs are required to have  two of the seven elements of a  

compliance program implemented for  their Part D benefit, but the other five  elements are waived for POs. While we  will continue to engage POs in  discussions regarding the benefits of  robust compliance programs, at this  time we do not believe it is appropriate  to require POs to implement the seven  elements of the MA/Part D compliance  program.    
*Comment:* Several commenters  suggested modifications to our  compliance oversight proposal. A few  commenters expressed concern with the  potential burden of a compliance  oversight program in PACE, and  recommended we consider modifying  the PACE compliance oversight program  to account for the small size of some  POs. These commenters recommended  we refer to the OIG guidance on  compliance programs for individual and  small physician practices (see 65 FR  59434 through 59452).    
*Response:* We appreciate these  concerns and consistent with the OIG  guidance cited by commenters, we took  the size and structure of POs into  account when proposing compliance  requirements for PACE. As we  

mentioned in the proposed rule (81 FR  54677), we balanced the need for POs to  maintain compliance with program  requirements with the fact that they  need flexibility as direct care providers.  We initially proposed that of the seven  compliance program elements in the  MA and Part D programs, only two of  these elements should be regulatory  requirements for all POs. However, after  reviewing the comments received, and  because we have a significant policy  interest in preventing undue burden, we  are only finalizing one of the two  proposed required elements. We believe  there is a need for organizations to be  able to identify non-compliance and  fraud, waste and abuse, and to take  corrective action when an issue is  discovered. We also believe that since  all POs already have a system in place  to respond to identified compliance  issues related to the Part D benefit, that  finalizing this element will only create  a minimal burden on POs.    
*Comment:* Two commenters requested  clarification on whether the PO must  operate the compliance oversight  program, or whether a parent  

organization of the PO could comply  with the compliance oversight  

requirements on behalf of the PO.  *Response:* The regulation as finalized  imposes compliance oversight  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00023 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**25632 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

requirements on the PO, but we    
intended for these requirements to    
provide flexibilities for POs. Each PO  must have procedures and an effective  system for promptly responding to  

compliance issues and correcting    
problems, but we will not dictate what  that system should look like or how it  should be structured. Since POs are  already required to have a system for  responding to compliance concerns in  their roles as Part D sponsors, we expect  that many organizations will adapt their  existing system to meet the PACE  

program requirements. However, the  individual organization has discretion  to choose to develop its compliance  oversight program, including whether or  not the compliance oversight program is  run through the PO or another entity  (such as a parent organization).    
As discussed previously, a majority of  commenters were supportive of our  proposal to implement a compliance  oversight program in PACE, while some  commenters raised concerns regarding  implementation and the associated  

burden of a compliance oversight    
program on small, direct care    
organizations. We agree with these    
commenters that further evaluation  should be done to determine the  

potential burden associated with    
implementing this provision as    
proposed, but we believe that finalizing  the second element within this  

provision would not impose a    
significant burden on organizations as,  in large part, they may be able to use the  systems for respond, investigate and  correct compliance issues they have in  place to comply with the requirements  for Part D plan sponsors. Based on these  comments, we are finalizing our  

proposed provision in part to require  POs to adopt a compliance oversight  program that requires POs to promptly  respond to, investigate and correct  

potential non-compliance and fraud,  waste and abuse.  

4\. Personnel Qualifications for Staff  With Direct Participant Contact  

(§ 460.64)  

Section 460.64 sets forth the    
personnel qualifications for staff with  direct participant contact. In the 2006  final rule (71 FR 71267), we added a  requirement at § 460.64(a)(3) that all  personnel that have direct participant  contact must have a minimum of 1 year  of experience with a frail or elderly  population. Our rationale was that the  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
PACE population is comprised of frail  or elderly individuals who must be  

cared for by staff with the specific    
training and experience necessary to  understand the complexities and  

differences in geriatric patients.  

However, as we explained in the  proposed rule, we are concerned that  many POs, especially those in rural  settings, may have candidates for PO  staff positions who meet all other  qualifications for a specific position  under § 460.64(a) but do not have 1 year  of experience working with the frail or  elderly population. We have approved  several waivers of this requirement. For  example, this situation often arises for  positions such as van driver or  transportation coordinator. We have  received anecdotal reports that some  POs encounter van drivers who have  many years of relevant experience as  school bus drivers but are unable to hire  these drivers based on the requirement  that staff with direct participant contact  have 1 year of experience working with  the frail or elderly population. We also  have approved this type of waiver  request for registered nurses (RNs),  social workers, and other direct care  providers.    
As we stated in the proposed rule, we  believe POs should be able to hire  individuals who meet all other  qualification requirements under  § 460.64(a) except for the 1 year of  experience requirement under  paragraph (a)(3), and provide training to  these individuals upon hiring. We  explained in the proposed rule that this  required training may be provided  either through a training entity or  directly by the PO. This training must  be based on industry standards in order  to provide these individuals with the  skills necessary to work with the frail or  elderly population in PACE. For  example, through training, an  

individual would be taught about the  complexities and differences in geriatric  patients, and that he or she needs to be  gentler, more patient and more  observant than with a healthy, younger  population. Therefore, we proposed to  amend § 460.64(a)(3) to state that a  member of the PO’s staff (employee or  contractor) who has direct participant  contact must have 1 year of experience  working with a frail or elderly  population or, if the individual has less  than 1 year of experience but meets all  other requirements under paragraph (a)  of § 460.64, must receive appropriate  training from the PO on working with a  frail or elderly population upon hiring.  As we noted in the proposed rule, this  would afford POs the flexibility to hire  an otherwise qualified individual with  less than 1 year of experience working  with the frail or elderly population and  subsequently provide the requisite  training.    
Current language in § 460.64(a)(4)  requires staff with direct participant  contact to meet a standardized set of    
competencies for a specific position  established by the PO and approved by  CMS before working independently. As  we explained in the proposed rule, we  continue to believe POs must establish  a competency evaluation program for  direct participant care staff as required  by § 460.71(a)(2) and discussed in the  2006 final rule (71 FR 71267\) to ensure  that staff have the skills, knowledge and  abilities needed to deliver safe care to  participants. However, we stated in the  proposed rule that we do not believe it  is necessary for CMS to approve those  competency evaluation programs prior  to their use. We expect the PO to use  current industry standards. Therefore,  we proposed to revise to this paragraph  to remove the reference to CMS  approval. We also proposed to make  technical, non-substantive changes to  the language in paragraph (a) by  changing the order of the current  language in order to make the provision  clearer and more concise.    
A discussion of the comments we  received on the proposed revisions to  § 460.64, and our responses to those  comments, appears below.    
*Comment:* Commenters supported  allowing POs to hire individuals with  less than 1 year experience with the frail  or elderly. Some commenters requested  that CMS define ‘‘appropriate training.’’  One commenter requested that we  require the training to be completed  prior to the individual performing any  direct care activities.    
*Response:* We appreciate the    
commenters’ support and will consider  the request to define ‘‘appropriate  training’’ and when it must be  

completed in the development of future  guidance.    
After considering the comments, we  are making no changes to our proposal  and are finalizing this provision as  proposed.  

5\. Training (§ 460.66)  

Section 460.66 requires the PO to  provide training for staff members and  to develop a specific training program  

for personal care attendants (PCAs).  Paragraph (b) requires the PO to develop  a training program for each PCA to  establish the individual’s competency in  furnishing personal care services and  specialized skills associated with the  specific care needs of individual  participants. Paragraph (c) states that  PCAs must exhibit competency before  performing personal care services  independently. We proposed to  redesignate § 460.66(b) and (c) to  § 460.71, ‘‘Oversight of Direct  

Participant Care,’’ as new paragraphs (c)  and (d), respectively, because § 460.71  already includes requirements regarding

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25633**  

training of staff and competency    
evaluations for employees and    
contracted staff furnishing care directly  to participants. As we explained in the  proposed rule, we believe including all  of the related requirements in the same  

section would reduce confusion over  applicable requirements. We did not  propose any changes to the language in  § 460.66(a) but proposed to remove the  paragraph designation of paragraph (a).    
We did not receive any comments on  these proposed changes, and therefore,  are finalizing this provision as  

proposed.  

6\. Program Integrity (§ 460.68)  

Section 460.68 was established to    
guard against potential conflicts of    
interest and certain other risks    
individuals and organizations could  present to the integrity of the PACE  program. Section 460.68(a) addresses  risks presented by a PO employing or  contracting with persons with criminal  convictions. Section 460.68(a)(1)  

addresses individuals and organizations  that have been excluded from  

participation in the Medicare or    
Medicaid programs. Section 460.68(a)(2)  addresses individuals and organizations  who have been convicted of criminal  offenses related to their involvement in  Medicaid, Medicare, other health  

insurance or health care programs, or  social service programs under title XX  of the Act. Section 460.68(a)(3)  

currently states that a PO must not    
employ individuals or contract with  organizations or individuals in any  

capacity where an individual’s contact  with participants would pose a potential  risk because the individual has been  convicted of physical, sexual, drug, or  alcohol abuse.    
As we explained in the proposed rule,  we believed the current language in  § 460.68(a) may not be tailored to  

effectively mitigate the risks that    
employing or contracting with certain  individuals and organizations with prior  convictions may pose to the PACE  

program, while still allowing POs to  hire and contract with individuals who  have had issues in their past that do not  pose a risk to the PACE program.  

Accordingly, we proposed to amend  § 460.68(a) by adding clarifying  

language to current paragraph (a)(3) and  by adding two new paragraphs (a)(4)  and (a)(5).    
We noted in the proposed rule that    
the current language in § 460.68(a)(3)  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
may have, in some cases, been    
overbroad so as to impair the PO’s    
ability to hire or contract with    
appropriate staff. For example, under  the current regulation, a PO is  

precluded from employing an  

individual with a conviction related to  underage drinking, who has not had a  conviction in adulthood, who is an  otherwise appropriately qualified  individual to work in a PO, and who  would pose no foreseeable threat to  participants. In such cases, persons who  have previously misused alcohol and  drugs and/or been diagnosed with  alcohol use disorder or substance use  disorder should not be categorically  excluded from serving PACE  

participants.    
In other instances, however, it is  possible that an individual’s past  criminal conviction or convictions  related to physical, sexual, drug, or  alcohol abuse could provide POs with  reason to believe that the individual  may pose a threat of harm to  

participants. For example, there is a  foreseeable risk of harm to participants  if a PO employs a transportation driver  who has a history of multiple Driving  Under the Influence (DUI) convictions.  We explained that we believed that it is  important for POs to consider an  individual’s past criminal convictions  and the potential risk to participants;  however, we do not want to limit POs’  ability to hire or contract with qualified  individuals. This reflects the direction  we have taken for long term care  facilities (for example, § 483.12(a)(3)(i)),  where specific restrictions are focused  on individuals that are found guilty of  abusing, neglecting or mistreating  nursing home residents.    
As such, we proposed to amend the  language at § 460.68(a)(3) to enable POs  to make a determination as to whether  an individual’s contact with  

participants would pose a potential risk  because the individual has been  convicted of one or more criminal  offenses related to physical, sexual,  drug, or alcohol abuse or use. We noted  that POs are still bound by state laws  governing the hiring of individuals that  provide care and services to the frail  elderly in state programs. We also noted  that the current language in  

§ 460.68(a)(3), which refers to ‘‘drug, or  alcohol abuse’’ does not parallel the  terminology used in criminal statutes,  which often do not use the term ‘‘abuse’’  to describe the misconduct at issue, and  also does not take into account criminal  convictions that could be related to drug  or alcohol use, such as DUIs, or drunken  and disorderly conduct. Therefore, we  proposed to amend the language to  include ‘‘drug, or alcohol abuse or use.’’    
We stated that although we do not  want to foreclose POs from employing  or contracting with qualified  

individuals or organizations that would  pose no harm to participants despite  past convictions, we proposed to add    
language in paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5),  to impose additional limitations on POs  employing or contracting with  

individuals or organizations that may  pose a risk to participants. In new  paragraph (a)(4), we proposed to add a  restriction stating that a PO must not  employ individuals or contract with  organizations or individuals who have  been found guilty of abusing, neglecting,  or mistreating individuals by a court of  law or who have had a finding entered  into the state nurse aide registry  concerning abuse, neglect, mistreatment  of residents, or misappropriation of  their property. This language parallels  regulatory restrictions applicable to long  term care facilities in § 483.12(a)(3)(i).  We noted in the proposed rule that we  believed these safeguards intended to  protect residents in long term care  facilities are equally appropriate  protections for participants in the PACE  program. In paragraph (a)(5), we  proposed to add a restriction stating that  a PO must not employ individuals or  contract with organizations or  

individuals who have been convicted of  any of the crimes listed in section  1128(a) of the Act. These offenses,  which are bases for mandatory  exclusion from federal health care  programs, are: (1) Conviction of  program-related crimes; (2) conviction  relating to patient abuse; (3) felony  conviction relating to health care fraud;  or (4) felony conviction relating to  controlled substance. Because we were  proposing to add two additional  paragraphs to paragraph (a), we  proposed to remove the word ‘‘or’’ at the  end of paragraph (a)(2). We also invited  public comment on whether we should  extend this provision to restrict hiring  those with certain criminal justice  histories to also include those with  current restraining orders against them.  

A discussion of the comments we  received on this topic, and our  responses to those comments, appears  below.  

*Comment:* Commenters expressed  support for our proposal to allow POs  discretion in hiring individuals who  have prior convictions but do not pose  a current risk to PACE participants. One  commenter agreed with our proposal,  with the caveat that there must be a high  level of training provided to these  individuals. One commenter requested  we clarify if a PO could consider a  conviction from another state.  

*Response:* We welcome the    
commenters’ support. We will consider  the comments specific to training and  convictions from other states in the  development of future guidance and are  finalizing the provisions as proposed.

*Comment:* In response to our request  for comment related to excluding  

individuals with current restraining  orders against them, commenters  

expressed concern that this would    
impose a higher standard than what is  required for nursing homes.    
*Response:* We thank the commenters  for responding to our request for  

comments on a potential restriction for  individuals with current restraining  orders against them. Many commenters  pointed out that this would result in  inconsistency with regulatory  

requirements for long term care    
facilities. After considering the    
comments, we are not making any    
changes to the PACE rules at this time  related to individuals with current  

restraining orders against them.  

7\. Contracted Services (§ 460.70)  

Sections 1894(b)(1)(A) and    
1934(b)(1)(A) of the Act state that, under  a PACE program agreement, a PO must  furnish items and services to PACE  participants directly or under contract  with other entities. Accordingly, we  require in § 460.70 that all  

administrative or care-related services,  except for emergency services as  

described in § 460.100, that are not    
furnished directly by a PO must be    
obtained through contracts that meet the  requirements specified in regulations. In  the proposed rule, we solicited  

comments on whether contracted    
services authorized by the PO or    
services operated directly by the PO  should comply with the Home and  

Community-Based Settings (HCBS)    
regulation at § 441.301(c)(4) when non institutional settings are used to house  and/or provide services to PACE  

participants, provided they do not    
conflict with requirements under this  section. We noted that the HCBS  

settings requirements apply broadly to  many different Medicaid authorities  (including state plan services and  

waivers, such as sections 1915(c),    
1915(i), and 1915(k) of the Act), but  currently do not apply to the delivery of  services by a PO under sections  

1894(b)(1)(A) and 1934(b)(1)(A) of the  Act. Because POs already support the  majority of participants in non 

institutional settings, we sought    
comments on whether or not CMS    
should apply the requirements to POs.  Although we did not propose any  

changes requiring compliance with  § 441.301(c)(4) when non-institutional  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
settings are used to house and/or    
provide services to PACE participants,  we solicited comments on possible  

proposals to do so in future rulemaking.  Changes we considered and on which  we solicited comments included:  

• Adding a new paragraph    
§ 460.70(b)(1)(iv) stating, a contractor  must comply with the HCBS regulation  at § 441.301(c)(4) when non 

institutional settings are used to house,  provide services to, or house and  provide services to PACE participants,  provided they do not conflict with  requirements under this section.  • Adding a new paragraph  

§ 460.98(b)(4) stating, the PO must  comply with the HCBS regulation at  § 441.301(c)(4) when non-institutional  settings are used to house, provide  services to, or house and provide  services to PACE participants, provided  they do not conflict with requirements  under this section.    
A discussion of the comments we  received on this topic, and our  responses to those comments, appears  below.    
*Comment:* Most commenters on the  topic expressed that the PACE model of  care is consistent with the principles  and objectives of the HCBS rule, in that  care is person-centered and affords  individuals choice in where, how and  from whom care is given. They stated  that under current PACE regulations,  POs are already required to ensure an  individual’s right to privacy, dignity  and respect, and freedom from coercion  and restraint. A commenter noted that  participation in PACE is voluntary, and  PACE provides a setting that creates a  safe community of individuals to gather  for meals and social stimulation to  prevent isolation. Commenters  expressed concern that a strict  

application of the HCBS requirement at  § 441.301(c)(4) could prevent POs from  providing care in the PACE center,  where a large proportion of PACE  participants access services, when it is  often necessary for participants with  dementia to attend the PACE center or  alternative care setting to ensure their  safety. In addition, commenters  expressed concern that strict application  of the HCBS regulation at § 441.301(c)(4)  may impact POs’ ability to provide care  to PACE participants in ways that have  been demonstrated to be successful at  delaying or preventing nursing home  placement. Commenters noted that it is  just as important to allow individuals  the right to choose to participate in  activities at the PACE center or other  congregate locations as it is to protect  their right to participate in activities in  other community settings. Commenters  also expressed concern that application  of the HCBS regulation at § 441.301(c)(4)  would impact PACE service delivery.  Some commenters suggested that  application of the HCBS regulation at  § 441.301(c)(4) has been inconsistent,  and has caused confusion for some    
providers, and raises safety and access  concerns for those caring for people  with certain conditions, such as  dementia.    
*Response:* Based on our review of  these comments, we agree with the  commenters that many of the existing  PACE objectives and requirements are  consistent with the requirements of the  HCBS regulation at § 441.301(c)(4). We  also recognize that some of the  principles of the HCBS settings  requirements could be adopted in PACE  to increase community integration  requirements for POs as they facilitate  participants’ ability to reside  

independently in the community.  Because POs have unique requirements  to provide care in both institutional and  non-institutional settings, and the role  of the PACE center is so fundamental to  the provision of PACE services, we  believe it is important to be thoughtful  before adding or expanding HCBS  setting requirements to PACE. We  appreciate all of the comments received  on this issue, and we plan to use the  feedback for consideration in future  rulemaking.    
*Comment:* While six commenters  expressed support for applying the  HCBS settings requirements to PACE,  they also expressed some concerns that  certain elements should or should not  apply to PACE. For example, some  commenters supported application of  the HCBS regulation at § 441.301(c)(4) to  all PACE settings except for the PACE  center. One commenter suggested a  delay in implementation of the HCBS  regulation in PACE, or that CMS allow  for flexibilities in applying HCBS  settings requirements to PACE. Another  commenter recommended that  alignment of the HCBS regulation at  § 441.301(c)(4) to PACE be postponed to  a later rulemaking in recognition of the  already integrated delivery structure  and person-centered approach in PACE.  Another commenter that supported the  application of the HCBS settings  requirements for non-intuitional settings  in PACE stated that PACE participants  living in settings such as assisted living  and residential care facilities should be  able to move into these types of setting.  One commenter expressed concern that  the eviction protection in the HCBS  settings rules may conflict with the  PACE involuntary disenrollment  regulations. Some commenters  supported application of the HCBS  regulation at § 441.301(c)(4) to PACE,  but stated that implementation should  not have the unintended consequence of  preventing POs or their contractors from  providing housing or services that  enable people to live independently in  their homes and communities

(including supports for family    
caregivers).    
*Response:* We appreciate the detailed  comments about how the HCBS  

regulation at § 441.301(c)(4) should or  should not apply in PACE, and will  continue to evaluate the appropriateness  of the application of the HCBS  

regulation in PACE and use this    
feedback for consideration in future  rulemaking.    
*Comment:* Some commenters stated  that the HCBS settings requirements  should be expanded to cover existing  PACE programs, and that any HCBS  provider must be held to the same  

standards and requirements. They    
expressed that even though PACE    
services often are provided at a specific  PACE center, the availability of services  at the center should not have the effect  of isolating participants from the  

broader community. Some commenters  expressed there is no reason why the  HCBS settings requirements should not  apply to PACE, since PACE, like other  HCBS options and waivers, is designed  to provide a non-institutional  

alternative for persons with LTSS needs.  Therefore, they stated that any HCBS  provided by POs, either directly or  

through contractual arrangements,    
should be subject to the HCBS    
regulation at § 441.301(c)(4). Several of  the commenters recommended that  CMS, in addition to incorporating the  HCBS settings requirements in  

§ 441.301(c)(4), should incorporate    
paragraph (c)(5). Paragraph (c)(4) sets  standards for HCBS settings, and  

paragraph (c)(5) describes settings that  cannot be considered home and  

community-based. Those commenters  stated that POs and their contractors  should comply with both of these  

paragraphs.    
*Response:* While we believe that    
many of the existing PACE objectives  and requirements are consistent with  the requirements of the HCBS Settings  final rule at 42 CFR part 441, we  

recognize that some of the principles of  that rule could be adapted in PACE to  increase community integration  

requirements for POs as they facilitate  participants’ ability to reside  

independently in the community.    
Because PACE differs from every other  HCBS program in that POs are required  to provide care in institutional and non institutional settings and the PACE  

center is so fundamental to the    
provision of services, we believe it is  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
important that we carefully and    
thoughtfully weigh many factors before  adding or expanding HCBS setting  

requirements to PACE. As a result, we  are not incorporating any HCBS settings  requirements into PACE at this time. We  

appreciate all of the comments received  on this issue, and plan to use the  feedback for consideration in future  rulemaking.    
In addition to soliciting comments on  the HCBS settings requirements, we  proposed several revisions concerning  contracts with entities that furnish  administrative or care-related services.  Section 460.70(d)(5) specifies the  required terms for contracts with  entities that furnish administrative or  care-related services. Sections  

460.70(d)(5)(vi) through (ix) address  additional contract requirements where  the PO chooses to contract with  individuals as IDT members or key  administrative staff. We explained in  the proposed rule that, although the  current provisions do not explicitly  reference those individuals, this was our  intent when we adopted the  

requirements in the 2002 IFC (67 FR  61498, 61505), and when we addressed  these requirements in the 2006 final rule  (71 FR 71270, 71335). We noted that  this is also how we have interpreted the  regulation in practice, however, we  understand it has caused confusion for  POs. To make the regulation clearer and  reduce confusion, we proposed to add a  new paragraph (d)(6) under which we  proposed to redesignate  

§ 460.70(d)(5)(vi) through (ix) as  § 460.70(d)(6)(i) through (iv) and state  that these contract requirements apply  to individuals providing contracted  services to the IDT or performing the  duties of the program director or  medical director. We also proposed to  make a technical change to the language  in former § 460.70(d)(5)(vii) (proposed  § 460.70(d)(6)(ii)) to change ‘‘meeting’’  to ‘‘meetings.’’    
We proposed to make a technical  change to § 460.70(e)(2) to change  ‘‘PACE Center’’ to ‘‘PACE center’’  consistent with the definition in § 460.6,  and other references throughout the  regulation. We proposed to revise  § 460.70(e)(2) to correct the reference  contained in that section by changing  § 460.98(d) to be § 460.98(c).    
A discussion of the comments we  received on the proposed changes to  § 460.70, and our responses to those  comments, appear below.    
*Comment:* Some commenters    
requested that we expand § 460.70, the  existing regulation that requires POs to  provide services directly or under  contract with other entities, to allow the  use of non-contracted providers.    
*Response:* Under the scope of benefits  described in sections 1894(b)(1) and  1934(b)(1) of the Act, a PO may enter  into written contracts with outside  entities to furnish services to  

participants that are not provided    
directly by the PO. Consequently, we  require in § 460.70 that all services,  except for emergency services as  described in § 460.100, not furnished  directly by a PO must be obtained  through contracts which meet the  requirements specified in regulations.    
*Comment:* One commenter requested  that we provide an exception to the  contract requirements in § 460.70 for  administrative or care-related services  that are provided by a PO’s parent  organization.    
*Response:* We would not grant such  an exception as we expect the PO to  have contractual arrangements for  accountability purposes with all entities  that furnish services not directly  furnished by the PO (except emergency  services), including the PO’s parent  organization. As the PO’s parent  organization can change, for example,  when a CHOW occurs, it is essential  that a contract is in place to show any  existing relationship and services  provided by the parent organization.    
Because the statute requires POs to  provide PACE services directly or  through contracts with other entities, we  do not believe we can expand § 460.70  to allow the use of non-contracted  providers in PACE as requested by the  commenters. After considering the  comments, we are finalizing the changes  to § 460.70 as proposed.  

8\. Oversight of Direct Participant Care  (§ 460.71)  

Section 460.71 identifies PO oversight  requirements for employees and  contracted staff with direct patient care  responsibilities. Paragraph (a) requires  the PO to ensure that all employees and  contracted staff furnishing care directly  to participants demonstrate the skills  necessary for performance of their  position, and further requires, under  paragraph (a)(1), that the PO provide an  orientation to all employees and  contracted staff. Paragraph (b) requires  the PO to develop a program to ensure  that all staff furnishing direct  

participant care services meet certain  requirements, including, under  paragraph (b)(4) that they are free of  communicable diseases and are up to  date with immunizations before  performing direct patient care.    
We proposed to make some technical,  non-substantive changes to paragraph  (a)(1) that would make the provision  more concise. We also proposed to  amend paragraph (b)(4). As we  explained in the proposed rule, our  intent when we amended § 460.71 in the  2006 final rule was to reflect our current  policy described in § 460.64(a)(5),  which states that PACE staff (employees  or contractors) who have direct  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00027 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**25636 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

participant contact must be medically  cleared for communicable diseases and  have all immunizations up-to-date  

before engaging in direct participant  contact (71 FR 71273). We noted that  § 460.71(b)(4) was not amended in a  consistent manner, which we  

understood caused confusion among  POs about whether to attach the same  meaning to ‘‘medically cleared for  

communicable diseases’’ and ‘‘free of  communicable diseases.’’ Therefore, we  proposed to amend § 460.71(b)(4) by  referencing the language previously  added to § 460.64(a)(5) so that both  

sections would be consistent and    
contain the same language.    
As noted previously in our discussion  of proposed changes to § 460.66, we  proposed to move paragraphs (b) and (c)  of § 460.66 related to personal care  

services furnished by PCAs to    
§ 460.71(c) and (d), respectively.    
A discussion of the comment we    
received on this topic, and our response  to that comment, appears below.    
*Comment:* One commenter stated that  the proposed rule does not specify a  minimum curriculum or minimum  

training standards for PCAs and    
suggested that the PACE manual define  the minimal competencies that PCAs are  expected to demonstrate before  

performing personal care tasks    
independently.    
*Response:* As we have previously    
stated in our discussion on personnel  qualifications for staff with direct  

participant contact (see subpart E.4.  (Personnel Qualifications for Staff with  Direct Participant Contact (§ 460.64)), it  is our expectation that POs follow  

industry standards with respect to the  skills required for working with the frail  or elderly population in PACE.  

Therefore, we do not believe it is    
necessary at this time to specify    
minimum training standards or    
competencies for PCAs.  

9\. Physical Environment (§ 460.72)  

Section 460.72 of the PACE    
regulations addresses requirements for  the physical environment of the PACE  center, including those pertaining to  space and equipment, fire safety, and  building safety. In the proposed rule, we  noted that CMS had published in the  December 27, 2013 **Federal Register** a  separate proposed rule that would affect  the PACE requirements for emergency  preparedness that, at the time, were  included in § 460.72 (see 78 FR 79802).  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
This proposal has now been finalized.  Specifically, on September 16, 2016, we  published in the **Federal Register** a final  rule titled ‘‘Medicare and Medicaid  Programs; Emergency Preparedness  Requirements for Medicare and  

Medicaid Participating Providers and  Suppliers,’’ which revised the PACE  requirements at § 460.72 and added a  

new § 460.84. The final rule (81 FR  63860\) established national emergency  preparedness requirements for 17 types  of Medicare- and Medicaid-participating  providers and suppliers, including POs,  to ensure that they adequately plan for  both natural and man-made disasters,  and coordinate with federal, state, tribal,  regional, and local emergency  

preparedness systems. For a complete  discussion of the PACE emergency  preparedness revisions, see the  September 16, 2016 final rule (81 FR  63904 through 63906).  

10\. Marketing (§ 460.82)  

Section 460.82 addresses    
requirements governing the marketing  activities of POs. Section 460.82  provides special language requirements,  and paragraph (c)(1) states that a PO  must furnish printed marketing  materials to prospective and current  participants in English and in any other  principal languages of the community.  We proposed to further clarify this  requirement by defining what we mean  by ‘‘principal languages of the  

community.’’ We noted in the proposed  rule that, as we stated in the 2006 final  rule (71 FR 71279), we believed the  determination of a principal language of  the community is a state determination.  However, we recognized that not all  states have an established standard for  when a language is considered to be a  principal language of the community (in  other words, a language threshold).  Where a state has not established such  a standard, we proposed the following  standard would be applied—a principal  language of the community would be  any language spoken in the home by at  least 5 percent of the individuals in the  PO’s service area.    
As we explained in the proposed rule,  we referred to any language spoken ‘‘in  the home’’ because U.S. Census data  identifies the principal language as the  primary language spoken in the home.  We noted that we established a similar  5 percent language threshold for  marketing materials in the Medicare  Advantage program (§ 422.2264(e)), and  we believed this threshold is also  appropriate for PACE. Moreover, we  stated in the proposed rule, we strive to  create harmony across program  requirements when feasible. This  reduces complexity for those  

organizations that operate multiple CMS  programs. We explained that, currently,  in the MA program, we determine  which MA organizations must provide  translated marketing materials by using  the U.S. Census Bureau’s American    
Community Survey (ACS) data, and we  then communicate that information to  plans via HPMS. We noted that we did  not propose to replace any state-based  language thresholds; rather the goal was  to provide a standard in instances where  a state standard does not exist.  Additionally, we noted in the proposed  rule, we would not preclude POs from  producing materials in alternative  languages when those languages are  spoken by less than 5 percent of the  individuals in the PO’s service area;  rather we aimed to set a more clear  standard for when furnishing such  materials is a requirement.    
We did not receive any comments on  our proposal to use the same approach  to the language threshold determination  as we do in the MA program, and  therefore, we are finalizing the  provision as proposed.    
Paragraph (e) pertains to prohibited  marketing practices and places certain  restrictions on PO employees and  agents. Paragraph (e)(3) states that gifts  or payments to induce enrollment are  prohibited. As we stated in the  proposed rule (81 FR 54680\) and the  2006 final rule (71 FR 71279), this  provision does not prevent a PO from  offering gifts of a nominal value. For  example, as we explained in the  proposed rule and 2006 final rule,  offering gifts to potential enrollees who  attend a marketing presentation is  permitted as long as these gifts are of a  nominal amount and are provided  whether or not the individual enrolls in  the PACE program. The gift cannot be a  cash gift or be readily converted into  cash regardless of the amount. To  ensure that our regulations reflect this  distinction, we proposed to amend  paragraph (e)(3) to specify that gifts or  payments to induce enrollment are  prohibited, unless the gifts are of  nominal value as defined in CMS  guidance, are offered to all potential  enrollees without regard to whether  they enroll in the PACE program, and  are not in the form of cash or other  monetary rebates. We stated in the  proposed rule that CMS currently  defines ‘‘nominal value’’ in section  30.10 of the PACE Marketing Guidelines  (*https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/  downloads/pace111c03.pdf*) to mean an  item worth $15 or less, based on the  retail value of the item, which is  consistent with the values in the  marketing guidelines under the  Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part  D programs. We noted in the proposed  rule that we believed the revision to  paragraph (e)(3) would preserve our goal  of ensuring that current and potential  PACE participants and their families or

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25637**  

guardians elect PACE based on the    
merits of the program versus the    
enticement of a gift, while clarifying  that POs have the ability to offer  

prospective participants a small gift  such as a pen with the organization’s  name and contact information without  the concern of violating the PACE  

marketing regulations. We stated that  similar flexibility has been permitted  under both the MA and Part D programs  for several years with no notable  

adverse impact to participants. As such,  we explained in the proposed rule, the  PACE program will continue to look to  these two programs to define the  

monetary value that constitutes a    
nominal gift. In addition, and consistent  with the MA and Part D programs, we  stated in the proposed rule that the  

PACE regulatory definition of a nominal  gift would exclude any gifts in the form  of cash or monetary rebates.  

Section 460.82(e)(4) prohibits    
contracting outreach efforts to    
individuals or organizations whose sole  responsibility involves direct contact  with the elderly to solicit enrollment.  Due to the particular nature of the PACE  program and the PACE population, we  stated in the proposed rule that we  

believed it is in the best interest of the  program to only permit POs to market  their programs through their own  

employees. Therefore, we proposed  amendments to this section to  

specifically prohibit POs from using  non-employed agents/brokers, including  contracted entities, to market PACE  programs.  

As we explained in the proposed rule,  the decision to enroll in a PACE  

program is significantly different from  the decision to enroll into other  

Medicare or Medicaid managed care  programs because PACE participants  must agree to receive all medical care  (as well as other services) from the PO  into which they enroll. This may mean  PACE participants must give up  

longstanding relationships with health  care providers, as well as become liable  for the costs of any unauthorized  

services. We noted that this is an    
important distinction that non   
employed agents and brokers may    
overlook when they market PACE    
programs to potential participants.    
Agents and brokers that do not work for  POs often sell other products, such as  Medicare Advantage and Medicare PDP  products. These products are    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
significantly different from PACE in  many respects, including the services  that are covered, the ways in which  participants receive the services, and  the enrollment requirements for  

participants.  

In the proposed rule, we expressed  concern that these substantial  

differences, combined with the typical  low enrollment numbers associated  with the PACE program, make it  difficult for agents and brokers that are  not employed by POs to fully  

understand and explain the PACE  program to potential participants. We  emphasized that our concern was less  about false marketing (which connotes a  malicious action) and more about  enrollment numbers not becoming the  primary motivation when marketing  PACE. An independent third party  would likely not have the opportunity  to develop the necessary expertise to act  as agents employed by a PO. We stated  we believed employees of the PO would  be the best equipped to provide  potential participants and their  caregivers with accurate information  about the PO, the services it provides  and the ramifications of receiving  services not approved by the PO’s IDT.  We noted this is especially important  given the vulnerable nature of the PACE  population, which is elderly and frail  and often has more complex health care  needs than Medicare or Medicaid  managed care populations, for which  the use of non-employed agents and  brokers for marketing may be more  appropriate.  

As we discussed in the proposed rule,  we believed that only permitting POs to  use employees for marketing activities  would help ensure potential PACE  participants fully understand the  program, the rules, how to access  services, and the ramifications of not  accessing services through the PO.  Accordingly, we proposed to amend  § 460.82(e) to remove the term ‘‘agents’’  and simplify the language. The revised  provision would preclude POs from  using certain prohibited marketing  practices. In conjunction with that  revision, we proposed to amend  paragraph (e)(4) to prohibit marketing  by any individuals other than the  employees of the PO. We noted that  some POs may have existing  

arrangements with independent agents  and brokers and that, as with other  functions, POs may delegate such  responsibilities to an outside entity. We  solicited comments as to whether CMS’  proposed prohibition on the use of  independent agents and brokers is  appropriate. We stated that if  

commenters believed that this    
prohibition is not appropriate, they  should provide specific reasons for  allowing their use, descriptions of how  POs contemplate using agents and  brokers, and the protections POs have in  place to ensure accurate information is    
provided to potential PACE    
participants. We describe the comments  we received on this proposal and our  responses at the end of this section.  Section 460.82(e)(5) prohibits    
unsolicited door-to-door marketing. We  proposed to add language to  

§ 460.82(e)(5) specifying that any other  unsolicited means of direct contact,  including calling or emailing a potential  or current participant without the  individual initiating contact, is a  prohibited marketing practice under  PACE. We explained that unsolicited  contact, for example, through telephone  (also known as ‘‘cold calling’’) or email,  is similar to, and generally as prevalent  if not more prevalent, than door-to-door  marketing, which is already expressly  prohibited under § 460.82(e)(5). We  stated the purpose of this addition is to  clarify that unsolicited means of direct  contact through telephone and email are  not allowed under PACE. Although we  declined in the 2006 final rule to  expand this prohibition beyond door-to door solicitation, we stated we would  continue to monitor marketing practices  by POs and would propose additional  safeguards as appropriate (71 FR 71279).  We explained in the proposed rule that  based on the vulnerability of the  population served by the PACE program  and the increase in health care fraud we  have seen since 2006, we believed a  prohibition on other unsolicited means  of direct contact is appropriate for  PACE. Moreover, we noted, such a  prohibition is consistent with our  marketing requirements for MA  organizations (§ 422.2268(d)) and PDP  sponsors (§ 423.2268(d)).  

We also proposed to remove    
§ 460.82(f), which requires that POs  establish, implement, and maintain a  documented marketing plan with  measurable enrollment objectives and a  system for tracking its effectiveness. We  explained that based on the insight we  have gained through years of oversight  responsibility for the PACE program, we  believed the requirement for a  

marketing plan is redundant. We noted  in the proposed rule that we believed  that the pertinent information captured  in the plan is attainable through other  account management activities. For  example, POs convey marketing strategy  in regularly scheduled meetings with  their CMS Account Managers. We  explained that the CMS Account  Managers are also made aware of  marketing materials and messages, as  well as the intended audience for such  materials and messages, through the  marketing submission and review  process. In addition, CMS has a separate  method for tracking enrollment data.

**25638 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

A discussion of the public comments  we received on our marketing proposals,  and our responses to those comments,  appears below.    
*Comment:* Commenters expressed    
concerns that the proposed simplified  language under § 460.82(e)(4) could be  construed as also prohibiting states and  advocates from educating potential  

participants about PACE. Several    
commenters expressed that POs should  maintain the flexibility of using  

contracted entities to assist them with  marketing activities. Two commenters  expressed agreement with our proposal  to restrict marketing to employees of the  PO. One such commenter expressed  concern with fraud, confusion, and  

abuse associated with marketing by non employees, while the other commenter  did not provide a reason for agreeing  with the proposed restriction.    
*Response:* As a result of the    
comments, we note that the proposal to  restrict marketing to employees of the  PO was not intended to preclude states  and advocacy groups from discussing  PACE with potential participants. To  clarify this position, we are revising  § 460.82(e)(4) to prohibit marketing by  any individual or entity that is directly  or indirectly compensated by the PO  based on activities or outcomes, as  

opposed to marketing by any    
individuals other than employees of the  PO. We are also revising our proposal to  differentiate between those entities  

which receive some level of    
compensation from the PO based on  activities or outcomes in marketing  

PACE on behalf of the PO, and those  who are educating potential participants  on a host of potential healthcare  

choices, but are not compensated by the  PO based on any activity or outcome,  such as State Health Insurance  

Assistance Programs (SHIPs) and other  advocates in the community.    
Additionally, based on the majority of  comments received, we believe it is best  to be less prescriptive with regard to  who can and cannot engage in  

marketing activities under PACE and to  instead revise our proposal to address  the root concerns of non-PO staff  

marketing PACE, such as a lack of    
understanding of the nuances of the  PACE program and/or PO that could  lead to an enrollment decision that is  contrary to the best interest of the  

potential participant. Specifically, we  are revising § 460.82(e)(4) to allow  

marketing by an individual or entity  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
that is directly or indirectly    
compensated by the PO based on    
activities or outcomes if the individual  or entity has been appropriately trained  in PACE program requirements,  

including but not limited to 42 CFR part  

460, subparts G and I of this part,  addressing participant rights and  participant enrollment and  

disenrollment, respectively. We are also  adding provisions in § 460.82(e)(4)(i)  and (ii) that state POs are responsible for  the activities of contracted individuals  or entities who market on their behalf,  and that POs that choose to use  contracted individuals or entities for  marketing purposes must develop a  method to document training has been  provided, respectively.    
By outlining expectations for the  appropriate training combined with  reiterating that the PO is responsible for  marketing activities conducted by others  on its behalf, we believe we are  providing additional flexibility to POs  while still safeguarding potential and  current PACE participants. Moreover,  we believe that this change will address  the concerns of fraud, confusion, and  abuse expressed by the commenter who  was in favor of the proposed agent  marketing prohibition.    
We are finalizing the other proposed  changes to the marketing  

requirements—§§ 460.82(c)(1), 460.82(e)  introductory text, 460.82(e)(3), and  460.82(e)(5)—as outlined in the  proposed rule.  

*G. Subpart F—PACE Services*  

1\. Service Delivery (§ 460.98)  

Section 460.98 addresses service  delivery under PACE. We proposed to  make a technical change to the heading  of § 460.98(d) to replace ‘‘PACE Center’’  with ‘‘PACE center’’ for consistency  with other references in § 460.98 and  throughout part 460\. Likewise, in  paragraph (d)(3) we proposed to replace  ‘‘Pace center’’ with ‘‘PACE center’’ for  the same reason.    
We also solicited public comments on  potential changes to our PACE center  requirements, which originated from the  PACE Protocol. As defined in § 460.6, a  PACE center is a facility which includes  a primary care clinic, areas for  

therapeutic recreation, restorative  therapies, socialization, personal care,  and dining, and which serves as the  focal point for coordination and  provision of most PACE services. Under  § 460.98(b)(2), PACE services must be  furnished in at least the PACE center,  the home and inpatient facilities, and  under § 460.98(c), certain minimum  services must be furnished at each  PACE center. Section 460.98(d) requires  a PO to operate at least one PACE center  either in, or contiguous to, its defined  service area with sufficient capacity to  allow routine attendance by  

participants. A PO must ensure  accessible and adequate services to meet    
the needs of its participants and, if  necessary, must increase the number of  PACE centers, staff, or other PACE  services. If a PO operates more than one  center, each PACE center must offer the  full range of services and have sufficient  staff to meet the needs of participants.    
As we explained in the proposed rule  (81 FR 54681\) and the 2006 final rule  (71 FR 71283), we believe the success of  the PACE delivery model has been  predicated on the combination of the  IDT assessment, care planning, and the  PACE center. The PACE center  requirement established in the original  PACE Protocol provides a point of  service where the primary care clinic is  located, where services are provided,  and socialization occurs with staff that  is consistent and familiar. The IDT not  only works from the PACE center, it also  provides the majority of services to  participants at the PACE center, where  most participants come on a regular  basis to receive the majority of their  care. Attendance at the center has been  considered an important aspect of the  PACE model of care, which helps to  differentiate it from home health care or  institutional care. We noted that more  recently, CMS has allowed participants  to receive services at alternative care  settings. However, those services are  meant to supplement, not replace, the  services that the PACE center must  furnish.    
We further explained in the proposed  rule that, over the years, we have  received a number of requests to  provide greater flexibility with respect  to the PACE center operation and  service requirements. We have heard  concerns that the development costs  and the length of time required to  establish a PACE center can be  significant and inhibit expansion of  existing programs. To better understand  the issues facing POs, in the proposed  rule, we solicited public comment on  ways to revise the current regulatory  requirements to allow greater flexibility  with regard to the settings in which IDT  members provide PACE services, while  still ensuring that PACE participants  can receive the full range of services and  benefits that has made PACE such a  successful model of care for this  population. We stated that we will use  public comments to inform future PACE  rulemaking concerning how to allow  greater flexibility with regard to the  settings in which IDT members provide  PACE services.    
A discussion of the public comments  we received on this topic, and our  responses to those comments, appears  below.    
*Comment:* Commenters generally  supported potentially allowing POs

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25639**  

greater flexibility to utilize alternative  care settings (for example, adult day  care centers, senior centers, or activity  areas in residential communities). One  commenter recommended that CMS  modify PACE requirements consistent  with certain principles including, for  example, that PACE participants must  be assigned to a PACE IDT, but the IDT  does not have to be assigned to a PACE  center. Many commenters stated that the  ability to deliver care in alternative care  settings would provide POs more  

flexibility in responding to participants’  needs and preferences, and promote  PACE growth and expansion in ways  that are not constrained by POs’ ability  to construct new PACE centers.  

However, other commenters expressed  concern regarding the potential for  

significant movement away from    
delivering care at the PACE center,    
which is considered the essence of the  PACE model of care, toward increased  reliance on providing care in settings  outside the PACE center. One  

commenter suggested that increased  flexibility in service delivery settings for  PACE may result in the program  

becoming more like network-based    
Medicare and Medicaid managed care  programs. Another commenter  

suggested that providing more flexibility  to POs with respect to service delivery  settings could result in an ‘‘unlevel  

playing field’’ between POs and other  health plans serving similar  

populations. Therefore, this commenter  recommended that as CMS works to  introduce flexibilities around the PACE  program, it should align standards and  requirements for POs with those for  other Medicare and Medicaid managed  care plans where appropriate.    
Commenters also suggested that CMS  would need to consider and provide an  opportunity for comment on the  

potential need for alignment across CMS  programs of various operational and  program requirements.    
*Response:* We appreciate the    
thoughtful comments and    
recommendations provided by    
commenters. The feedback will help  inform future PACE rulemaking.    
*Comment:* Many commenters    
supported testing use of the PACE    
model of care for new populations    
under section 1115A of the Act, which  was afforded by the PACE Innovation  Act of 2015 (PIA), including testing the  PACE model of care for individuals  younger than 55 with disabilities, who  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
are currently ineligible for PACE    
because of their age. Some commenters  expressed concern regarding the  

opportunity to test expansion of PACE  under this authority. For example, one  commenter stated that any future model    
test under section 1115A of the Act, as  amended by the PIA, to serve  

individuals with psychiatric disabilities  should be governed by the January 16,  2014 Medicaid final rule 7 that  

establishes the requirements and limits  applicable to Medicaid HCBS in order to  restrict the use of a PACE center as a  location for the delivery of services to  this population. Another commenter  urged us to use the authority provided  by the PIA to find affordable ways to  extend the PACE model of care to older  adults with Medicare who need LTSS  but are not eligible for Medicaid.  Finally, the Medicare Payment Advisory  Commission (MedPAC) urged us to  consider changes to the PACE rate  setting and risk adjustment  

methodologies to increase the accuracy  of payments under any model test.  

*Response:* We appreciate the    
recommendations on potential tests of  the PACE model of care under the  authority of section 1115A of the Act, as  amended by the PIA. We will continue  to consider future opportunities to  conduct model tests under this  authority. However, our focus currently  is on developing models through which  we would directly contract with a range  of Medicare providers and suppliers,  and these providers and suppliers  would agree to be accountable for cost  and quality in providing care to a  defined beneficiary population. We are  working to ensure these potential  models would provide opportunities to  test innovative ways to serve people of  all ages who have complex chronic  conditions and/or functional  

impairments, building on what has  worked well with the PACE clinical  approach. Comments on the PIA are  

beyond the scope of this rule, as this  rule pertains to the existing PACE  program, and any potential waivers of  existing PACE regulations, changes to  payment methodology or modifications  to eligibility criteria for a model test  under section 1115A of the Act as  amended by the PIA would be  

addressed as appropriate for each  model. However, we will take the  commenters’ input, as well as the  comments received in response to the  

PACE Innovation Act Request for  Information 8 issued December 23, 2016,  into account as we develop future  model tests.

*Comment:* In response to a proposed  revision to the IDT role of the primary  care provider, commenters suggested a  corresponding revision to § 460.98(c)(1)  to state that primary care services  furnished at the PACE center may be  provided by a physician, nurse  practitioner or physician assistant.  

*Response:* Section 460.98(c)(1)  currently refers to primary care services  as including physician and nursing  services. However, as discussed in  section III.G.3. of this final rule, we  proposed and are finalizing changes to  § 460.102(b) and (c) to permit primary  medical care to be furnished by a  primary care provider, meaning a  primary care physician, a community based physician, a physician assistant  (provided certain requirements are met),  or a nurse practitioner (provided certain  requirements are met). We appreciate  the suggested revision and agree that it  would help ensure consistency between  the two sections of the regulation.  Therefore, we will revise § 460.98(c)(1)  to refer to the minimum services  furnished at each PACE center as  including ‘‘primary care, including  services furnished by a primary care  provider as defined in § 460.102(c) and  nursing services.’’ This change will  recognize that primary care can be  provided not only by physicians and  nurses, but also by other types of  primary care providers, as defined in  § 460.102(c).  

*Comment:* One commenter requested  that we provide more detailed guidance  with respect to alternative care settings  in PACE.  

*Response:* We did not propose any  changes regarding alternative care  settings, so we consider this topic to be  beyond the scope of this rule. We direct  the commenter to the guidance we  issued on alternative care settings in  PACE. (See the June 30, 2016 HPMS  memorandum, Clarification on the  Requirements for Alternative Care  Settings in the PACE Program.)  

2\. Emergency Care (§ 460.100)  

Section 460.100 addresses emergency  care under PACE. We proposed to make  a technical revision to § 460.100(e)(3)(i)  by replacing references to ‘‘POs’’ and  

‘‘PO’’ with references to ‘‘PACE  organizations’’ and ‘‘PACE  

organization,’’ respectively, to make the  language consistent throughout  § 460.100 and with other references in  part 460\.  

We did not receive any comments on  this proposal, and therefore, we are  finalizing the change as proposed.

3\. Interdisciplinary Team (§ 460.102)  

Section 460.102 sets forth the    
requirements for an IDT, which are    
based on provisions in Part IV, section  B of the PACE Protocol (64 FR 66248).  As we have stated previously in  

preambles to rules and subregulatory  guidance (*http://cms.gov/Regulations and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/*  

*Downloads/pace111c08.pdf*), we believe  a well-functioning IDT is critical to the  success of the PACE program because  the team is instrumental in controlling  the delivery, quality, and continuity of  care. Further, members of the IDT  

should be knowledgeable about the  overall needs of the participants, not  just the needs that relate to their  

individual disciplines (64 FR 66248; 71  FR 71285; 81 FR 54682). Section  

460.102(a)(1) requires that the PO    
establish an IDT at each PACE center to  comprehensively assess and meet the  individual needs of each participant.  Section 460.102(b) specifies the  

composition of the team and provides  that it be comprised of at least the 11  members listed in the section.    
Under sections 1894(f)(2)(B)(iii) and  1934(f)(2)(B)(iii) of the Act, the IDT  approach to care management and  

service delivery is a requirement that  cannot be waived. However, we  

explained in the proposed rule that we  understood there may be circumstances  when it would be difficult for a PO to  have a separate individual fill each of  the 11 IDT roles, which may be an  

obstacle for the expansion of the PACE  program, especially in rural areas. To  provide greater flexibility for POs, we  proposed that a PO be permitted to have  one individual fulfill two separate roles  on an IDT when the individual meets  applicable state licensure requirements  and is qualified to fill each role and able  to provide appropriate care to meet the  participant’s needs. For example, we  noted, a registered nurse cannot fill the  role of a Master’s-level social worker  unless the registered nurse also has a  master’s degree in social work. Under  § 460.190 and § 460.192, CMS and the  SAA monitor POs during the trial  

period and perform ongoing monitoring  after the trial period to ensure that POs  are in compliance with all PACE  

requirements. We explained in the    
proposed rule that these monitoring  activities will serve as a safeguard to  help ensure there is no negative impact  to the quality of care being provided.  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
During these reviews, CMS and the SAA  can confirm that when an IDT member  is serving in two IDT roles, participants’  needs are still being met. As such, we  proposed to revise paragraph (a)(1) to  state that the IDT must be composed of  

members that fill the roles described in  paragraph (b). We also proposed to  revise paragraph (b) to state the IDT  must be composed of members qualified  to fill, at minimum, the following roles,  in accordance with CMS guidelines. We  stated that we will publish the IDT  guidelines in HPMS following  

publication of the final rule. We noted  that paragraph (b) would also state that  one individual may fill two separate  roles on the IDT where the individual  meets applicable state licensure  requirements and is qualified to fill the  two roles and able to provide  

appropriate care to meet the needs of  participants.    
A discussion of the public comments  we received on our proposal regarding  IDT roles, and our response to those  comments, appears below.    
*Comment:* Commenters supported the  proposal to allow one individual to fill  two separate roles on the IDT where the  individual has the appropriate licenses  and qualifications for both roles.    
*Response:* We appreciate the support  for this proposal and will finalize the  revisions as proposed. As noted  previously, we will publish IDT  guidelines in HPMS following the  publication of the final rule.    
Section 460.102(b)(1) currently  provides that the IDT must include a  primary care physician, and § 460.102(c)  requires that primary medical care be  furnished by a PACE primary care  physician who is responsible for  managing a participant’s medical  situations and overseeing a participant’s  use of medical specialists and inpatient  care. As we stated in the proposed rule,  we are aware that changes in the  practice of medicine and state licensing  laws have expanded the practice of non physician practitioners (for example,  nurse practitioners), such that these  practitioners in many cases are able to  fulfill the role served by the primary  care physician. Thus, including those  individuals on the IDT in the role of the  primary care provider may prove to be  more operationally feasible and cost effective, particularly in rural areas or  areas where labor costs may be high. We  noted that we have approved requests  by POs to waive the requirement at  § 460.102(b)(1) and (c) so that primary  medical care can be furnished by  someone other than a primary care  physician on the IDT, thus allowing POs  to deliver care through a non-physician  primary care provider (such as a nurse  practitioner or physician assistant) or a  community-based physician. We stated  that we have typically granted such  waivers, and we have not encountered  any issues or concerns with the quality  of care provided by non-physician    
primary care providers or community based physicians acting in this capacity  on behalf of and working collaboratively  with the PACE primary care physician  or medical director.    
As we explained in the proposed rule  (81 FR 54682), 1999 IFC (64 FR 66248),  and the 2006 final rule (71 FR 71285),  the role of primary care physician on  the IDT was based on the PACE Protocol  and codified in regulation. In the 2006  final rule, we explained that we  considered expanding this role to  include nurse practitioners but decided  to retain the PACE Protocol  

requirement. We noted our view at the  time that it would be acceptable to  include a nurse practitioner on the IDT,  but it should be in addition to rather  than instead of a primary care  

physician. We also stated in the 2006  final rule that such a change should be  included in a proposed rule in order to  allow for public comment on this issue;  and in the meantime we would continue  to assess the appropriateness of  allowing nurse practitioners to assume  the role of the primary care physician  consistent with state licensure  

requirements for nurse practitioners (71  FR 71285).    
As discussed in the proposed rule, the  PACE program agreement has replaced  the PACE Protocol. We noted that, like  certain other requirements that were  based on the PACE Protocol, we  believed the composition of the IDT  needs to change to reflect evolving  medical practices and technologies. We  stated that we believed it is appropriate  to expand the primary care physician  role on the IDT to include certain other  primary care providers. Accordingly, we  proposed to revise § 460.102(b)(1) to  specify that a primary care provider,  rather than a primary care physician,  must be part of the core IDT. Further,  we proposed to revise § 460.102(c)(1) to  permit primary medical care to be  furnished by a primary care physician,  a community-based physician, a  physician assistant (provided certain  requirements are met), or a nurse  practitioner (provided certain  

requirements are met). We also  proposed to revise § 460.102(c)(2) to  refer to primary care provider rather  than primary care physician. We stated  that these changes would allow all POs  to furnish primary care through these  other types of providers, thereby  reducing burden on the POs without  compromising care.    
For physician assistants and nurse  practitioners, we proposed to add  language in paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) and  (iv) to require that they be licensed in  accordance with state law and practice  within their scope of practice as defined

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25641**  

by state laws with regard to oversight,  practice authority, and prescriptive  authority. We noted that, with  

increasing shortages of primary care  providers across the country, we  

believed affording POs the flexibility to  involve other non-physician  

practitioners practicing collaboratively  with the PACE primary care physicians  would enable the POs to accommodate  

more participants and expand their  programs, without comprising quality of  care.    
We proposed redesignating the    
current language in paragraph (e) as  paragraph (f) and, in a new paragraph  (e), we proposed to add language that  references the requirements in § 460.71,  which sets forth guidelines for the  

oversight of employees and contracted  staff that have direct patient contact. We  explained that referencing § 460.71  

should make it clear to POs that they  must ensure that all members of the IDT  demonstrate the skills necessary for the  performance of their positions as  

required under § 460.71. Additionally,  we noted, this will require the PO to  confirm that all members of the IDT  comply with state certification or  

licensure requirements for direct patient  care in their respective settings. The PO  and its medical director are responsible  

for the oversight of all care provided to  PACE participants.    
A discussion of the public comments  we received on our proposal regarding  primary care providers on the IDT, and  our responses to those comments,  

appears below.    
*Comment:* Commenters strongly    
supported revising the regulations to  require a primary care provider to serve  on the IDT instead of requiring a  

primary care physician. This would  permit nurse practitioners, physician  assistants, and community-based  

physicians to fill this role. Some    
commenters suggested what they    
believed to be necessary corresponding  revisions to other sections of the PACE  regulations related to the settings in  which a primary care provider provides  services. Specifically, commenters  

suggested that we clarify in § 460.98  whether a primary care provider may  provide services in a community-based  setting. Similarly, the commenters  

requested a clarifying revision to    
§ 460.98(c)(1) regarding the primary care  services furnished at the PACE center. A  few commenters recommended that a  nurse practitioner be listed as a provider  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
who can serve as the medical director  for a PO. Commenters also questioned if  the PO’s medical director must be a  medical doctor.    
*Response:* We appreciate the support  for the proposed revisions to § 460.102  

regarding the primary care provider and  will finalize that change to the  regulation as proposed. Regarding the  suggestion that we clarify whether a  primary care provider may provide  services in a community-based setting,  we do not believe that a clarification is  necessary in light of the removal of the  ‘‘primarily served’’ requirement  discussed below. We do appreciate the  suggested clarifying revision to  § 460.98(c)(1) to ensure consistency  between the two sections of the  regulation. As discussed in section  III.G.1. of this final rule, we are revising  § 460.98(c)(1) to refer to ‘‘primary care,  including services furnished by a  primary care provider as defined in  § 460.102(c) and nursing services’’.  Regarding the role of the PACE medical  director and which disciplines can serve  in this capacity, we initially proposed  regulation text at § 460.60(b) that would  require a PO to employ or contract with  a physician in accordance with § 460.70,  to serve as its medical director  responsible for the delivery of  

participant care, for clinical outcomes,  and for the implementation, as well as  oversight, of the quality improvement  program. However, at this time, we are  

not finalizing the change to specify that  a physician must as serve as the medical  director. We intend to address questions  regarding the PACE medical director  role in future guidance or rulemaking.  

Currently, § 460.102(d)(3) states that  the members of the IDT must serve  primarily PACE participants. The  ‘‘primarily served’’ requirement was  part of the original PACE Protocol (64  FR 66249). However, section 903 of  BIPA authorizes the Secretary to modify  or waive such provisions in a manner  that responds promptly to the needs of  PACE programs relating to areas of  employment and the use of community based primary care physicians. We  proposed to revise § 460.102(c)(1) to  allow community-based physicians to  fill the role of primary care provider on  the IDT. As we explained in the  proposed rule, community-based  physicians are different from the PACE  primary care physician. The PACE  primary care physician works for the PO  and is responsible for all PACE  participants within the PO. The  community-based physician generally  works in a different practice, outside of  the PO, but may also contract with the  PO in order to work with select PACE  participants who prefer to continue to  receive their primary care services from  their community-based physician.  Community-based physicians usually  provide care for the patients in  community settings, such as outpatient    
clinics, and patients in those    
community settings often become PACE  participants. Newly enrolled PACE  participants often request to continue  receiving care from their community based physician. We noted in the  proposed rule that we wanted to allow  this flexibility for PACE participants  because we believed it supports the  continuity of care for participants.  Therefore, we proposed to amend  § 460.102(d)(3) to allow flexibility with  respect to community-based physicians  by excluding them from the requirement  that they serve primarily PACE  participants. As proposed, community based physicians would be able to  continue working in their community  settings while contracting with the POs  to provide PACE services. We also  stated in the proposed rule that, in  combination with the revision to  paragraph (b)(1), this would effectively  be a global waiver of the IDT member  and ‘‘primarily served’’ requirements for  community-based primary care  physicians.    
A discussion of the public comments  we received on our proposal regarding  the ‘‘primarily served’’ requirement, and  our responses to those comments,  appears below.    
*Comment:* Most commenters    
concurred with eliminating the  ‘‘primarily served’’ requirement for  community-based physicians and  suggested that this be extended to other  types of community-based providers  and possibly all members of the IDT.    
*Response:* We thank the commenters  for their support for this change. In  response to these comments, as well as  in response to comments we received on  the alternative IDT proposals that are  discussed next, we are finalizing  changes to the ‘‘primarily served’’  requirement that renders our proposal  on community-based physicians  unnecessary. Changes to the ‘‘primarily  served’’ requirement are further  discussed below.    
In the proposed rule, we also    
considered two alternative possibilities  for revising parts of § 460.102 to provide  greater flexibility to POs without  compromising quality of care. In the  first alternative, we considered deleting  the requirements in § 460.102(b) related  to the composition of the IDT. As noted  previously, under sections  

1894(f)(2)(B)(iii) and 1934(f)(2)(B)(iii) of  the Act, the IDT approach to care  management and service delivery is a  requirement that cannot be waived.  However, the PACE statutes do not  specifically address the composition of  the IDT.    
As we explained in the proposed rule,  we continue to believe that a well

functioning IDT is critical to the success  of the PACE program, as the team is  instrumental in controlling the delivery,  quality, and continuity of care. As we  stated in the proposed rule (81 FR  

54683\) and the 1999 IFC (64 FR 66248),  members of the IDT should be  

knowledgeable about the overall needs  of the patient, not just the needs which  relate to their individual disciplines. In  order to meet all of the health,  

psychosocial, and functional needs of  the participant, team members must  view the participant in a holistic  

manner and focus on a comprehensive  care approach. We noted in the  

proposed rule that we considered    
whether to provide even greater    
flexibility to POs, while maintaining our  expectation of a well-functioning,  

knowledgeable IDT, by deleting the IDT  composition requirements in  

§ 460.102(b). Under this alternative    
approach, we would expect the    
composition of the IDT could be tailored  based on each individual participant  and the PO would continue to assess the  need for services and provide all  

necessary services. Similar to the    
revisions to § 460.102(c), we would  require that primary care be furnished  by a PACE primary care provider. CMS  and the SAA would continue to monitor  POs to ensure that participants are  

receiving all necessary care. We noted  that these monitoring activities would  serve as a safeguard to help ensure there  is no negative impact to the quality of  care being provided. We stated that we  believed this alternative approach of  deleting the IDT composition  

requirements in § 460.102(b) could    
provide greater flexibility to POs    
without compromising the quality of  care. We solicited public comments on  this approach. A discussion of the  

comments we received on this option,  and our response to those comments,  appears below.    
*Comment:* Most commenters    
expressed opposition to deleting IDT  composition requirements. Several  

suggested that we retain the    
composition requirement for an IDT but  modify it to allow for a range of health  professionals and functions that  

participate in assessment and care    
planning based on the needs of    
individual PACE participants. One    
commenter thought that we should    
continue to require every member of the  IDT to be present in the development of  a participant’s plan of care.    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
*Response:* We thank the commenters  for their input on the first proposed  alternative approach. In response to a  majority of commenters who expressed  concern regarding the deletion of IDT  composition requirements, we have  

determined that the current    
requirements should be retained at this  time.    
As discussed in the proposed rule, in  the second alternative, we considered  deleting § 460.102(d)(3), which requires  that members of the IDT must serve  primarily PACE participants. Again, this  requirement was based on the PACE  Protocol, which has now been replaced  by the PACE program agreement. As we  stated in the proposed rule (81 FR  54683), the 1999 IFC (64 FR 66249\) and  the 2006 final rule (71 FR 71286), for a  frail elderly population, such as is  served by the PACE program, it is  important to support and retain  measures that promote quality and  continuity of care. We explained that if  team members serve primarily PACE  participants, they are able to develop a  rapport with participants and are better  able to plan for and provide their care.  Over the years, we have received and  approved numerous requests to waive  the ‘‘primarily served’’ requirement for  members of the IDT, such as the primary  care physician or the Master’s-level  social worker, in order to allow POs  needed flexibility in staffing their IDTs.  We have not encountered any issues or  concerns after granting such waivers.  Thus, we solicited public comments on  whether we should extend this  flexibility to all POs without the need to  request a waiver.    
*Comment:* Most commenters    
concurred with eliminating the  ‘‘primarily served’’ requirement for  community-based physicians and  suggested also eliminating the  

requirement for other types of    
community-based providers and all  members of the IDT. In addition, some  commenters believed that the current  requirement, *i.e.* ‘‘primarily serve’’ is  vague and has led to misinterpretations  of this requirement. In addition,  commenters emphasized the operational  challenges POs face, which can lead to  a need for qualified staff that can serve  on a part-time, rather than full-time  basis. Other commenters stated that the  use of community-based physicians has  expanded the range of primary care  providers PACE participants can choose  from, and in many cases has permitted  participants to retain their existing  primary care physician when enrolling  in PACE. A few commenters  

recommended retaining the ‘‘primarily  served’’ requirement and expressed  concern that members of the IDT should  be knowledgeable and experienced with  the needs of the PACE population. One  commenter acknowledged that  including community-based physicians  on the IDT likely promotes continuity of  care for newly-enrolled participants, but    
may cause conflicts regarding treatment  and the approval of services over time.  This commenter asserted that the  inclusion of community-based  physicians should continue to be  addressed through the waiver process.  Other commenters supported the  proposals but indicated that protections  must be in place to ensure the integrity  of the PACE organization’s mission.  *Response:* We have carefully  

considered the comments we received  on this proposal, as well as the  comments we received on the similar  proposal related to community-based  physicians. Overall, commenters were  very supportive of the change to  eliminate the ‘‘primarily served’’  requirement for individuals who serve  on the IDT. However, some commenters  expressed concerns about eliminating  this requirement based on the belief that  providers that primarily serve PACE  participants, with presumably more  direct and extensive experience  rendering care to the PACE population,  would be best positioned to understand  and address the needs of those  participants. While we understand this  concern, we believe that community based providers, regardless of their  experience serving a PACE population,  nonetheless must have the requisite  expertise and ability to practice within  the scope of their licensure. As long as  these community-based providers are  willing to fulfill the requirements for  members of the IDT, we do not believe  they should be precluded from doing so  based on a requirement that they  ‘‘primarily serve’’ PACE participants.  Comments received were supportive of  our proposals overall and support our  conclusion that the benefits of requiring  IDT members to have experience serving  PACE participants, in and of itself, do  not outweigh the benefits of eliminating  the ‘‘primarily served’’ requirement. We  note, as did certain commenters, that a  number of waivers have been granted of  the ‘‘primarily served’’ requirement for  members of the IDT in recent years,  with beneficial results. Furthermore, we  are not aware of any adverse impact in  overall quality of care for POs operating  under such waivers. We agree with  commenters that use of community based providers has promoted  

continuity of care, allowed POs greater  flexibility in the delivery of primary  care to participants, and has increased  operating efficiencies without  

compromising quality of care. We note  that quality of care provided by POs will  continue to be a focus of CMS and SAA  oversight and monitoring activities. By  reducing operational challenges and  expanding PACE participant provider

choices, we continue to support efforts  to ensure PACE participants have access  to quality care and qualified providers.  Based on the supportive comments we  received, as well as our positive  

experience in granting waivers of the  ‘‘primarily served’’ requirement, we are  revising the regulations to delete the  requirement that members of the IDT  must serve primarily PACE participants.  Specifically, we will update the  

regulation by removing § 460.102(d)(3).  4\. Participant Assessment (§ 460.104)    
Section 460.104 sets forth the    
requirements for PACE participant    
assessments. As we explained in the  proposed rule (81 FR 54683\) and the  2006 final rule (71 FR 71288), the  

information obtained through the    
participant assessment is the basis for  the plan of care developed by the IDT.  As such, it is important that the  

assessment be as comprehensive as    
possible to capture all of the    
information necessary for the IDT to  develop a plan of care that will  

adequately address all of the    
participant’s functional, psychosocial,  and health care needs.    
Section 460.104(a) sets forth the    
requirements for the initial    
comprehensive assessment, which must  be completed promptly following  

enrollment. Currently all members of  the IDT must be present for the initial  assessment, representing each required  clinical discipline to appropriately  

assess the PACE participant’s holistic  needs and develop a customized plan of  care. We stated in the proposed rule  that, under our proposal to modify  

§ 460.102, to the extent an IDT member  serves multiple roles on the IDT, that  member may represent the clinical  

expertise for which he or she is    
qualified. Other team members may be  present as necessary. In § 460.104(a)(2),  we state that certain members of the IDT  must evaluate the participant in person  as part of the initial comprehensive  assessment but, in paragraph (a)(1), we  do not specify that the initial  

comprehensive assessment must be an  in-person assessment. Therefore, we  proposed to add the phrase ‘‘in-person’’  after ‘‘initial’’ in paragraph (a)(1). We  explained that our longstanding policy  has been that the initial assessment is an  in-person assessment, so the addition of  this language should make this  

requirement clear but not change the  current practice. We also proposed to  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
change the requirement that the initial  comprehensive assessment be  

completed ‘‘promptly following    
enrollment’’ to ‘‘in a timely manner in  order to meet the requirements in  

paragraph (b) of this section.’’ We noted  

in the proposed rule that this would  allow the PO to complete this  

assessment at a time that works for the  PO, but within a timely manner so as to  allow the IDT to complete the  

development of the plan of care within  30 days of the date of enrollment.  Currently, during the initial  

comprehensive assessment, a primary  care physician must evaluate the  participant and develop a discipline specific assessment of the participant’s  health and social status. We proposed to  change ‘‘primary care physician’’ to  ‘‘primary care provider’’ in paragraphs  (a)(2)(i) and (c)(1) to be consistent with  proposed changes to the composition of  the IDT in § 460.102. As discussed in  section III.G.2. of this final rule, we  proposed that the primary care  physician role be changed to primary  care provider to allow other licensed  primary care providers (specifically,  nurse practitioners, physician assistants,  and community-based physicians) to be  part of the core IDT.    
In § 460.104(a)(2), we proposed to  remove the reference to IDT members  initially evaluating participants ‘‘at  appropriate intervals’’ because the  scheduling of the discipline-specific  assessments as part of the initial  comprehensive assessment is up to the  POs, and we believed stating that they  must occur ‘‘at appropriate intervals’’ is  unnecessary and superfluous language.  We proposed to change the language in  § 460.104(a)(3) from ‘‘individual team  members’’ to ‘‘the interdisciplinary  team’’ so that language is consistent  throughout these regulations and  because it is the IDT’s decision whether  to include other professionals in the  initial comprehensive assessment.  Additionally, we proposed to add the  word ‘‘initial’’ before ‘‘comprehensive  assessment’’ so it is clear that  

professionals may be included in the  initial comprehensive assessment, as  opposed to a reassessment. We  proposed two changes to § 460.104(a)(4)  to clarify that the initial comprehensive  assessment covers all aspects of the  participant’s physical, social, and  mental needs. Currently, the heading is  titled ‘‘Comprehensive assessment  criteria.’’ We proposed to revise the  heading to ‘‘Initial comprehensive  assessment criteria.’’ We also proposed  to add ‘‘in-person’’ to this section to  make it consistent with the terminology  in § 460.104(a)(1) and (2). We stated in  the proposed rule that we believed an  initial comprehensive assessment is a  more valuable tool for identifying the  participant’s need for services when  performed in person.    
Section 460.104(b) states that the IDT  must ‘‘promptly’’ consolidate    
discipline-specific assessments into a  single plan of care for each participant  through discussion ‘‘in team meetings.’’  We noted in the proposed rule that the  term ‘‘promptly’’ does not provide  definitive direction for an IDT to know  when the discipline-specific assessment  should be completed and incorporated  into a plan of care. We proposed to  change this provision to specify that the  plan of care must be completed ‘‘within  30 days of the date of enrollment’’ to  remove the ambiguity of ‘‘promptly.’’  We stated that we believed 30 days  balances the need for time to complete  these activities with the need to  complete these activities within a  reasonable amount of time.    
Moreover, we noted in the proposed  rule, it is our understanding that some  POs interpret the term ‘‘team meeting’’  as requiring members of the IDT to be  

physically present in the meeting. We  stated that we believed POs need the  flexibility to determine the format and  location of IDT discussions to best meet  the needs of PACE participants while  not burdening the IDT by requiring  these discussions to be held in face-to face meetings. In paragraph (b), we  proposed to change the words  

‘‘discussion in team meetings’’ to ‘‘team  discussions’’ to indicate that there must  be a team discussion, but the format (for  example, video conferencing,  

conference call, or in-person meeting)  and location of the discussion would be  at the discretion of the PO.    
We also proposed to create a new  paragraph under § 460.104(b). Under  new paragraph (b)(1), we proposed to  

state that if the IDT determines from its  assessment that any services associated  with the comprehensive assessment  criteria listed in paragraph (a)(4) do not  need to be included in a participant’s  plan of care, the IDT must document in  the participant’s plan of care the reasons  such services are not needed and are not  being included. We explained in the  proposed rule that if the IDT does not  believe a PACE participant needs a  certain service as it relates to the IDT  care plan assessment findings, and  therefore, does not authorize that  service, the IDT must document the  rationale for not including the service in  the plan of care. We noted that we  would expect the plan of care to reflect  that the participant was assessed for all  services even where a determination is  made that certain services were  unnecessary at that time. We proposed  to move the current requirement in  paragraph (b)—that female participants  must be informed that they are entitled  to choose a qualified specialist for  women’s health services from the PO’s  network to furnish routine or preventive

women’s health services—to new    
paragraph (b)(2).  

Currently, § 460.104(c) sets forth the  requirements for periodic  

reassessments, including semiannual  and annual reassessments. Section  

460.104(d) discusses the requirements  for unscheduled reassessments. We  noted in the proposed rule that our  

experience has demonstrated that the  requirement to perform both semiannual  and annual reassessments can be overly  burdensome and unnecessary in that  participants are consistently being  

monitored for changes and are already  reassessed whenever there is a change  in their health status. Accordingly, we  proposed to delete the requirement in  

paragraph (c)(2) requiring the annual  reassessments by the physical therapist,  occupational therapist, dietician, and  home care coordinator. We proposed to  delete corresponding references to  

annual reassessments in paragraph (d).  We proposed to keep the requirement  that PACE participants be reassessed  semiannually, every 6 months. We  

stated that we would change the list of  IDT members that must conduct the  semiannual assessment to include the  primary care provider, registered nurse,  Master’s-level social worker, and any  other IDT members actively involved in  the development or implementation of  the participant’s plan of care, as  

determined by the IDT members whose  attendance is required. We noted in the  proposed rule that we believed PACE  participants should be reassessed at  least every 6 months as this will better  ensure that PACE participants, who are  generally frail, are receiving appropriate  treatment. We proposed to remove  

‘‘recreational therapist or activity    
coordinator’’ from the list of IDT    
members that must participate in the  semiannual reassessment. As stated in  the proposed rule, we believed reducing  the number of IDT members who are  required to participate in the semi 

annual assessment will reduce the    
burden on POs and allow the POs to  allocate their resources more efficiently,  while still meeting the care needs of  participants. We explained in the  

proposed rule that POs have reported  that recreational therapists and activity  coordinators are not needed at every  reassessment. POs further report that to  require that recreational therapists or  activity coordinators be present at every  semiannual reassessment is unnecessary  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
and can be overly burdensome.    
However, recreational therapists and  activity coordinators are part of the IDT  and can update the IDT on the  

participants’ successes or needs for    
recreational therapy or involvement in  

activities. We stated in the proposed  rule that we believed the primary care  provider, registered nurse, and Master’s level social worker can collectively  determine, based on the participant’s  plan of care and IDT discussions, which  other IDT members should be present  during the semiannual assessment. As  such, we stated that we did not believe  we needed to require that the  

recreational therapist or activity  coordinator be present at the  

semiannual reassessment unless the  primary care provider, registered nurse,  and Master’s-level social worker  determine that the recreational therapist  or activity coordinator needs to be  present because that individual is  actively involved in the development or  implementation of the participant’s plan  of care.    
The requirements for semiannual  reassessments are currently at (c)(1)(i)  through (v) and would be redesignated  as paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4). In  the redesignated paragraph (c)(1), we  proposed to revise ‘‘physician’’ to  ‘‘provider’’ for consistency. We also  proposed to redesignate paragraph  (c)(1)(v) as (c)(4) and revise the  provision to delete the examples.  Section 460.104(d) discusses  

unscheduled reassessments. We  proposed changes to paragraph (d) to  remove the reference to annual  reassessments. We proposed to change  the language in (d)(1) from ‘‘listed in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section’’ to  ‘‘listed in paragraph (c) of this section.’’  As we explained in the proposed rule,  this would change the requirement for  unscheduled reassessments in the case  of a change in participant status so that  only the IDT members listed in  paragraph (c) will have to conduct the  unscheduled reassessment. Specifically,  the primary care provider, registered  nurse, Master’s-level social worker, and  other team members actively involved  in the development or implementation  of the participant’s plan of care would  conduct the participant’s unscheduled  reassessment. Similarly, we proposed to  change paragraph (d)(2), regarding  unscheduled reassessments at the  request of the participant or the  participant’s designated representative,  to also align with IDT members listed in  paragraph (c). We noted in the proposed  rule that we believed reducing the  number of IDT members that are  required to conduct the unscheduled  reassessments would reduce the burden  on POs and allow the POs to allocate  their resources more efficiently, while  still meeting the care needs of  

participants.    
We noted in the proposed rule that,  under § 460.64, PO staff with direct    
participant contact must only act within  the scope of their authority to practice.  Therefore, if the IDT members believe a  participant may need care that is not  within the scope of their respective  practices, those members would need to  involve other IDT members as  

appropriate. We stated in the proposed  rule that, for these reasons, we did not  believe we needed to require all core  members of the IDT to conduct  unscheduled reassessments.    
A discussion of the public comments  we received on our proposals regarding  participant assessments under  

§ 460.104, and our responses to those  comments, appears below.    
*Comment:* Some commenters did not  support the proposed changes to  § 460.104(d)(1) and (2) as they believed  that not all service requests require an  in-person assessment by each of the IDT  members included in paragraph (c).  These commenters suggested the IDT  should retain the ability to determine  which members of the IDT should  conduct the reassessment, and include  those IDT members that are actively  involved in the participant’s plan of  care. Another commenter stated that  some PACE participants have become  overwhelmed by the large number of  IDT members managing their care and,  as a result, have disenrolled from the  PACE program. Several commenters  expressed the need to make the most  effective use of IDT resources while  meeting the needs of PACE participants.  Lastly, a commenter requested that CMS  clarify whether it has any concerns that  providing POs with this greater  flexibility could impact the quality of  care for PACE participants.    
*Response:* In an effort to align    
§ 460.104(d)(1) and (d)(2), we    
inadvertently increased the number of  IDT members required for in-person  reassessments in (d)(2). In support of  our efforts to reduce provider burden  and balance the needs of PACE  participants and PO resources, we  believe that POs should retain the  ability to identify the appropriate IDT  members needed for an unscheduled  reassessment at the request of the  participant or designated representative  as § 460.104(d)(2) currently permits, and  we did not intend to require all IDT  members referenced in § 460.104(c) to  participate in conducting these  reassessments. We do not anticipate that  maintaining the current requirement  will impact the quality of care for PACE  participants as we will continue to rely  on POs to apply their clinical expertise  when conducting unscheduled  reassessments and expect that the IDT  will involve other IDT members as  appropriate.

Based on the comments received    
about unnecessary and potentially    
overwhelming IDT member presence at  reassessments, as well as the  

implications of our inadvertent change  to align requirements, we are not  

finalizing the IDT member changes to  § 460.104(d)(2) as proposed and will  maintain the current requirement.    
*Comment:* In general, commenters    
concurred with the proposed revisions  to § 460.104. However, commenters  expressed concern regarding the  

proposed revision to § 460.104(c)(2) that  would eliminate the requirement for  annual reassessments that include the  other team disciplines such as physical  therapist (PT), occupational therapist  (OT), dietician, and home health  

coordinator. Commenters stated that by  deleting the annual reassessment by the  other team disciplines, POs may miss an  opportunity to identify new or emergent  participant issues. Commenters believed  that an annual assessment by these  

disciplines is beneficial for the PACE  participant.    
*Response:* We appreciate the    
comments regarding the role of the other  team disciplines, such as PTs, OTs,  dieticians and home health  

coordinators, in patient assessments and  that they continue to be included in an  annual assessment. However, we will  continue to require reassessments to be  performed on a semiannual basis, that  is, every 6 months. We believe that the  primary care provider, registered nurse,  and Master’s-level social worker who  participate in the semiannual  

reassessment can collectively    
determine, based on the participant’s  plan of care and IDT discussions, which  other IDT members should be present  during this reassessment. We expect the  other disciplines, such as OTs and PTs,  to be included as needed. As previously  stated, PO staff with direct participant  contact must only act within the scope  of their authority to practice, so if the  IDT members listed in paragraph (c)  believe a participant may need care that  is not within the scope of their  

respective practices, those members  should involve other IDT members as  appropriate. For these reasons, after  considering the comments, we are  

finalizing the changes to § 460.104(c)(2)  as proposed.    
*Comment:* Commenters suggested that  we allow POs to conduct in-person  

initial comprehensive assessments and  reassessments using modern technology  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
such as video conferencing, where    
participants and the IDT members are  able to interact ‘‘face-to-face’’ and in real  time but from different locations.  

Another commenter requested CMS  allow for the use of remote technologies,  

noting that doing so would be    
particularly helpful in rural areas due to  longer travel times and higher costs  associated with conducting in-person  reassessments. Other commenters  expressed that not all service requests  warrant an in-person reassessment.  These commenters noted that in some  cases, such requests could easily be  addressed by the IDT members most  familiar with the participant and  actively involved in the plan of care.  These IDT members would evaluate the  request and update the care plan  accordingly.  

*Response:* We appreciate the    
recommendations regarding the use of  modern technology in conducting initial  assessments and reassessments and  minimizing the burden associated with  in-person reassessments for service  requests, especially those requests that  do not involve complex clinical  decision making and/or input from  specialty providers. In addition, we  recognize that the current in-person  requirements for unscheduled  

reassessments in response to service  requests can sometimes delay access to  services because of the time necessary to  coordinate among the appropriate IDT  members and conduct the in-person  reassessment. Based on the comments  we received in response to the  discussion of PACE participant  assessments in the proposed rule, we  have carefully examined the  

reassessment requirements to determine  whether it may be appropriate for a  reassessment to be conducted via  remote technology in some  

circumstances, as suggested by  commenters, to ensure timely delivery  of services and reduce burden on POs.  As a result of feedback from the  industry recommending that we allow  the use of remote technology to reduce  the burden associated with in-person  reassessments, and to more efficiently  address the care needs of PACE  participants and afford POs more  flexibility, we are revising  

§ 460.104(d)(2) to specify that POs may  use remote technologies to perform  unscheduled reassessments in some  circumstances. Specifically, when a  participant (or his or her designated  representative) makes a request to  initiate, eliminate or continue a  particular service, also known as a  service request, the appropriate  members of the IDT, as determined by  the IDT, may use remote technologies to  conduct unscheduled reassessments  when the IDT determines that the use of  remote technology is appropriate, the  service request will likely be deemed  necessary to improve or maintain the    
participant’s overall health status, and  the participant or his or her designated  representative agrees to the use of  remote technology. While we are not  eliminating the requirement to perform  unscheduled reassessments in response  to service requests, or to conduct those  reassessments in person in certain cases,  we believe that permitting POs to use  remote technologies to conduct  reassessments under the circumstances  described above will facilitate  

appropriate evaluation of PACE  participants and promote the timely  delivery of care and effective  

communication between the IDT and  the participant and his or her designated  representative. The regulation will  continue to require POs to conduct a  reassessment in response to a service  request. However, we are revising the  regulation to allow the appropriate  member(s) of the IDT, as identified by  the IDT, to conduct the reassessment  using remote technology in specific  circumstances. We expect that POs will  use remote technology for service  requests that are necessary to maintain  participants’ health and well-being in  the community setting, and may include  services such as improving sanitary  conditions in the home, respite care, or  items needed to manage and treat non complex medical conditions.  

Additionally, POs must still conduct an  in-person reassessment prior to denying  a service delivery request and cannot  use remote technology to conduct these  reassessments.    
We want to emphasize that remote  technologies should be used on a case by-case basis and may not be  

appropriate for participants that have  complex medical needs and/or require a  more hands-on approach for conducting  unscheduled reassessments. We expect  IDT members to utilize their clinical  judgment in determining when remote  technologies are appropriate and when  an unscheduled reassessment should be  conducted in-person, without using  remote technologies.    
In addition, we expect that    
circumstances may arise that warrant a  follow-up ‘‘in-person’’ reassessment. For  example, during an unscheduled  reassessment initially conducted using  remote video technology, the IDT may  determine that a more extensive  evaluation is needed that cannot be  accomplished through remote  

technologies. We consider remote  technologies that allow interactive and  immediate dialogue between the IDT  and the PACE participant, caregiver,  and/or designated representative to be  appropriate for conducting  

reassessments. This includes    
reassessments via telephone, video

conferencing, live instant messaging and  chat software, or other media that allow  sufficiently direct and interactive  

communication to permit the IDT to  assess the participant’s health status and  evaluate the need for a particular  

service.    
Based on our audit findings and    
general oversight of POs, we have found  that the majority of service requests are  approved, and can and should be  

processed by POs in a more expeditious  manner. Audits conducted during  

calendar years 2017 and 2018 found that  many service requests were not  

processed in a timely manner, leading to  delays in the provision of the requested  service. According to the 2017 PACE  Annual Report, 55 out of 74 POs were  cited for not processing service requests  in a timely manner. Feedback from the  POs suggests that the administrative  burden associated with conducting in person reassessments often causes  

delays in processing service requests  and decision making regarding whether  to approve or deny a request. Because  the majority of service requests are  

approved, we have determined that the  use of remote technologies is most  

appropriate for this type of unscheduled  reassessment because it will reduce  travel times and help to more  

expeditiously connect the IDT to PACE  participants in the community,  

especially those who reside in rural  settings and/or receive the majority of  care in settings outside the PACE center  due to physical or cognitive limitations  or participant preference. We also  

believe this policy will help to prevent  delays in care for fairly straightforward  service requests that do not involve  complex clinical decision making.    
We emphasize that the use of remote  technologies will be voluntary for  

participants, and POs cannot mandate  that participants and/or their caregivers  or designated representatives utilize  such technologies during unscheduled  reassessments. If a participant does not  wish to allow for reassessments to be  conducted with remote technologies,  the IDT must conduct the reassessment  in-person without using remote  

technology.    
We encourage POs to utilize remote  technologies as appropriate to improve  communication with participants in all  aspects of care delivery, however, use of  remote technology does not supersede  requirements that mandate in-person  reassessments. This includes    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
unscheduled reassessments at the    
request of the participant or designated  representative where the PO would  deny a request; under § 460.104(d)(2),  we will continue to require POs to  

conduct an in-person reassessment  

before denying a request from a PACE  participant.    
The timeframe for notifying the  participant or designated representative  of the PO’s decision to approve or deny  the request will remain unchanged, and  must be done in accordance with  § 460.104(d)(2)(ii) through (iv). We also  note that under § 460.104(e)(4), POs  must furnish any approved services in  the revised plan of care as expeditiously  as the participant’s health condition  requires.    
Lastly, at this time we do not believe  it would be appropriate to conduct  initial comprehensive assessments and  other periodic reassessments through  remote technologies. These assessments  must continue to be performed in person without the use of remote  technology because they help to  establish and/or maintain the  

therapeutic relationship between PACE  participants and/or their caregivers and  the PO, and we do not want to create  circumstances in which the IDT misses  an opportunity to identify new or  emergent participant issues due to the  inherent limitations of remote  

technologies, especially in    
circumstances where a more hands-on  approach and/or in-person visualization  is needed to more accurately and  effectively evaluate participant care  needs. In summary, with the exception  of IDT member requirements in  § 460.104(d)(2), we are finalizing all the  other changes to § 460.104 as proposed.  In addition, based on public comments,  we are further amending the regulation  in § 460.104(d)(2) to allow for the use of  remote technologies to conduct  unscheduled reassessments in response  to service delivery requests when the  IDT determines that the use of remote  technology is appropriate and the  service request will likely be deemed  necessary to improve or maintain the  participant’s overall health status and  the participant or his or her designated  representative agrees to the use of  remote technology.  

5\. Plan of Care (§ 460.106)  

Section 460.106 requires that the IDT  establish, implement, coordinate, and  monitor a comprehensive plan of care  for each participant. As we noted in the  proposed rule, the purpose of the plan  of care is to help support the  

identification of potential or actual areas  of improvement and monitor  

progression and outcomes. The current  regulatory language pertaining to the  basic requirement and the content of the  plan of care in this section has been  described by POs as confusing and  unclear. Therefore, we proposed to  revise this section by adding    
requirements to provide more clarity  without changing the fundamental  aspects of the plan of care process.  First, we proposed to change  

§ 460.106(a) from requiring that a plan  of care be developed promptly to state  that the plan of care must be developed  ‘‘within 30 days of the date of  

enrollment.’’ We explained in the  proposed rule that the term ‘‘promptly’’  does not provide definitive direction for  an IDT to know when the discipline specific assessments under § 460.104(b)  should be completed and incorporated  into a plan of care. Requiring that the  plan of care be developed within 30  days of the date of enrollment balances  the need for time to complete the  assessments and develop a plan of care  with the need to complete the plan of  care within a reasonable timeframe. We  noted that this proposed change is  consistent with the proposed changes to  § 460.104(b).    
Next, we proposed to add language to  clarify which members of the IDT are  required to develop the plan of care  within 30 days. The proposed language  stated that the IDT members specified in  § 460.104(a)(2) must develop the plan of  care for each participant based on the  initial comprehensive assessment  findings. We noted in the proposed rule  that the added language aimed to clarify  for POs which members of the IDT  should develop the plan of care. The  IDT members in § 460.104(a)(2) are  members of the IDT that are required to  conduct the initial comprehensive  assessment and would remain  

responsible for developing the plan of  care based on the initial discipline specific assessments. We acknowledge  here that both §§ 460.104(b) and  460.106(a) mention the development of  a plan of care, however, only  

§ 460.106(a) includes changes that  reference the IDT members in  

§ 460.104(a)(2). We clarify here that the  intent of § 460.104(b) is to achieve  consensus among all IDT team members  in developing one single plan of care,  and that requirement is unchanged in  this rule. The changes to § 460.106(a)  specify which IDT members must be  involved in the development of the plan  of care based on their expertise and  insights gained from conducting those  comprehensive initial assessments,  while § 460.104(b) maintains the  requirement that the single plan of care  must have the consensus of all IDT  members through team discussions with  the full IDT as indicated in the  regulation and preamble discussions. In  other words, while the eight disciplines  responsible for conducting initial  assessments will actively develop the  proposed plan of care, the care plan  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00038 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25647**  

cannot be finalized without a team    
discussion with the full IDT included in  § 460.102(b)(1) through (11) to gather  input from all remaining IDT members  and consensus from the full team. We  believe that all members of the IDT  

bring valuable perspectives to this    
process and therefore reiterate that the  changes to the IDT members required to  develop the plan of care in § 460.106(a)  do not impact the requirement in  

§ 460.104(b) that all IDT members agree  upon the plan of care through team  

discussions.    
Section 460.106(b) sets forth the    
content of the plan of care and states  that the plan of care must meet the  

following requirements:    
• Specify the care needed to meet the  participant’s medical, physical,  

emotional and social needs, as    
identified in the initial comprehensive  assessment;    
• Identify measurable outcomes to be  achieved.    
We noted in the proposed rule that we  believed these requirements are  

appropriate, but may have, in the past,  led to confusion regarding the overall  purpose, goal, creation, implementation  and follow-up process of the plan of  care. We stated that current regulations  do not explicitly require POs to follow  industry standards in developing and  following care plan interventions. We  noted that we believed adding new  

requirements will help POs to    
effectively and efficiently identify and  address each participant’s care planning  needs. Therefore, we proposed to add  three new requirements to § 460.106(b).  In paragraph (b)(3), we proposed to  

require that the plan of care utilize the  most appropriate interventions (for  

example, care improvement strategies)  for each of the participant’s care needs  that advances the participant toward a  measurable goal and desired outcome.  In paragraph (b)(4), we proposed to  

require that the plan of care identify  each intervention and how it will be  implemented. We stated in the proposed  rule that interventions should be  

targeted, specific actions implemented  to improve a participant’s health care  outcome. And finally, in paragraph  

(b)(5), we proposed to require that the  plan of care identify how each  

intervention will be evaluated to    
determine progress in reaching specified  goals and desired outcomes.    
The following is a summary of the    
public comments we received on the  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
proposed changes to the plan of care  requirements in § 460.106 and our  

responses to comments.    
*Comment:* Overall, commenters    
supported the proposed revisions to  § 460.106. A few commenters urged  

CMS to provide exceptions for  extenuating circumstances (such as  when a participant is hospitalized or out  of the service area during the initial 30  days of enrollment, or services are  disrupted due to catastrophic weather related events) to the requirement for  developing a comprehensive plan of  care within 30 days of the date of  enrollment.    
*Response:* In consideration of the  supportive comments, we are finalizing  this provision as proposed. However,  we wish to address the recommendation  regarding an exception to the  

requirement for developing a    
comprehensive plan of care within 30  days of the date of enrollment due to  extenuating circumstances. We  recognize that there may be  

circumstances, albeit rare, that would  prevent a PO from conducting a timely  comprehensive assessment for newly enrolled PACE participants. However,  this is a fundamental part of care  planning and is key to a PO’s ability to  fulfill its mission and provide quality  care to its participants. Therefore, it is  our expectation that POs will comply  with the 30-day timeframe in  

§ 460.106(b) and make every effort to  conduct timely assessments in order to  develop and begin to implement the  individualized plan of care in a timely  manner. In those rare situations in  which the circumstances prevent a  timely assessment, and development of  a plan of care, the PO is expected to  document the specific circumstances  and detail the steps taken to provide  immediate care as needed and complete  the assessment and plan of care as soon  as feasible given the circumstances.  

*H. Subpart G—Participant Rights*  

1\. Specific Rights to Which a Participant  Is Entitled (§ 460.112)  

Section 460.112 describes the specific  rights of PACE participants, including,  in paragraph (b)(1), the right to be fully  informed in writing of services available  from the PO:    
• Before enrollment;    
• At enrollment; and    
• At the time a participant’s needs  necessitate the disclosure and delivery  of such information to allow informed  choice.    
We proposed to combine paragraphs  (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) into proposed  paragraph (b)(1)(i) to state that  

information about PACE services will be  provided ‘‘prior to and upon  

enrollment’’ in the PO, and to    
redesignate current paragraph (b)(1)(iii)  as paragraph (b)(1)(ii), in an effort to  simplify the language and regulatory  construction.    
Section 460.112(b)(3) states that each  participant has the right to examine, or  upon reasonable request, to be assisted  in examining the results of the most  

recent review of the PO conducted by  CMS or the SAA and any plan of  correction in effect. We proposed to  make a technical change to  

§ 460.112(b)(3) by deleting the language  ‘‘to be assisted’’ and replacing it with  ‘‘to be helped.’’ The changes to  § 460.112(b) are not substantive in  nature but are intended to simplify the  regulatory language.    
Sections 1894(c)(5)(A) and    
1934(c)(5)(A) of the Act provide that  participants must be permitted to  voluntarily disenroll from PACE  without cause at any time. Accordingly,  § 460.112(c)(3) states that each PACE  participant has the right to disenroll  from the program at any time. We  explained in the proposed rule that we  have operationalized this requirement  by allowing participants to provide  notice of voluntary disenrollment at any  time and making that disenrollment  effective on the first day of the month  after the PO receives the notice.  Consistent with our current practice, we  proposed to revise paragraph (c)(3) to  state that the participant has the right to  disenroll from the program at any time  and have such disenrollment be  effective the first day of the month  following the date the PO receives the  participant’s notice of voluntary  disenrollment as set forth in  

§ 460.162(a). As discussed in the  proposed rule (81 FR 54686\) and section  III.J.5. of this final rule, we proposed a  corresponding revision to § 460.162 that  would state, in a new paragraph (a), that  a voluntary disenrollment is effective on  the first day of the month following the  date the PO receives the participant’s  notice of voluntary disenrollment. We  explained in the proposed rule that,  because POs receive a monthly  capitation payment from Medicare and/  or Medicaid in advance, we effectuate  the disenrollment at the end of the  capitated payment period.    
We received no comments on our  proposed revisions to § 460.112, and  therefore, we are finalizing this  provision as proposed.  

2\. Explanation of Rights (§ 460.116)  

Section 460.116 sets forth    
requirements for POs with respect to  explanation of rights, such as having  written policies and procedures on  these rights, explaining the rights, and  displaying the rights. Section  

460.116(c)(1) provides that the PO must  write the participant rights in English  and in any other principal languages of  the community. Consistent with the

**25648 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

proposal regarding marketing materials  under § 460.82(c)(1), discussed in  

section III.F. of this final rule, we    
proposed to specify that if a state has  not established a standard for making  the principal language determination, a  principal language of the community is  any language spoken in the home by at  least 5 percent of the individuals in the  PO’s service area. As we explained in  the proposed rule, we established a  similar 5 percent language threshold for  marketing materials in the MA program  (§ 422.2264(e)), and we believed this  threshold is also appropriate for PACE  because of the similarities in population  make-up between the MA program and  PACE. Moreover, we noted in the  

proposed rule, we strive to create    
harmony across program requirements  when feasible. This reduces complexity  for those organizations that operate  

multiple programs.    
Section 460.116(c)(2) states that the  PO must display the participant rights  in a prominent place in the PACE  

center. We proposed to add the word  ‘‘PACE’’ before the words ‘‘participant  rights’’ to specify that participant rights  specific to PACE must be displayed. We  explained in the proposed rule that  during CMS audits of POs, we have  observed that POs have displayed rights  pertaining to the adult day center or  other rights, and not those specific to  the PACE program, in the PACE center.  As proposed, the language would  

explicitly state that the PACE    
participant rights must be posted in the  PACE center. We received no comments  on our proposed changes to § 460.116,  and therefore, we are finalizing the  

changes as proposed.  

3\. PACE Organization’s Appeals Process  (§ 460.122)  

Section 460.122 sets forth the    
requirements for a PO’s appeals process.  Section 460.122(c)(1) states that a PO’s  appeals process must include written  procedures for timely preparation and  processing of a written denial of  

coverage or payment as provided in  § 460.104(c)(3). In the 2006 final rule,  we redesignated paragraph (c)(3) to  

paragraph (d) in § 460.104, but we    
inadvertently did not make the    
corresponding change to the citation  referenced in § 460.122(c)(1) (71 FR  71292, 71336, and 71337). Therefore, we  proposed to amend § 460.122(c)(1) to  provide the correct citation reference to  the standards for a written denial notice  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
by changing it from § 460.104(c)(3) to  § 460.104(d)(2)(iv).    
We did not receive any comments on  our proposed technical change to  

§ 460.122(c)(1). Therefore, we are    
finalizing this provision as proposed.  

*I. Subpart H—Quality Assessment and  Performance Improvement*  

As discussed in section III.A. of this  final rule, to update the terminology to  comport with that used in other CMS  programs, we proposed to replace all  references to ‘‘quality assessment’’ and  ‘‘performance improvement’’ with  ‘‘quality improvement’’ throughout part  460, including the heading for subpart  H and the titles of various sections. In  this section, we discuss the other  changes that we proposed to subpart H.  

1\. General Rule (§ 460.130)  

Sections 1894(e)(3)(B) and    
1934(e)(3)(B) of the Act require that,  under a PACE program agreement, the  PO, CMS, and the SAA shall jointly  cooperate in the development and  implementation of health status and  quality of life outcome measures with  respect to PACE participants. Section  460.130 requires a PO to develop,  implement, maintain, and evaluate a  quality assessment and performance  improvement program, which reflects  the full range of services furnished by  the PO. Further, a PO must take actions  that result in improvement in its  performance in all types of care.  

Section 460.140 refers to additional  quality assessment activities related to  reporting requirements. We proposed to  move the requirement in § 460.140 to  § 460.130 as new paragraph (d), so that  all of the general rules for quality  improvement would be part of the first  section in subpart H. As we noted in the  proposed rule, this change would leave  no requirements under § 460.140, so we  also proposed to remove § 460.140.  

2\. Quality Assessment and Performance  Improvement Plan (§ 460.132)  

Section 460.132 sets forth our current  requirements with respect to a Quality  Assessment and Performance  

Improvement (QAPI) plan. We proposed  to revise the requirements for a QAPI  plan in § 460.132. In addition to the  terminology change that we discussed  previously (replacing all references to  ‘‘quality assessment and performance  improvement’’ with the term ‘‘quality  improvement’’), we proposed to revise  paragraph (a) to require a PO to have a  written quality improvement plan that  is collaborative and interdisciplinary in  nature. As we explained in the proposed  rule, the PACE program is unique in its  structure in that it has a collaborative  and interdisciplinary approach in  treatment of PACE participants. We  stated that we believed a PO’s quality  improvement plan should reflect this  collaboration and interdisciplinary  approach in its improvement goals. That    
is, any time the PO’s governing body  develops a plan of action to improve or  maintain the quality of care, the plan  should focus on the collaborative and  interdisciplinary nature of the PACE  program. For example, a PO may  identify as a goal the need to improve  its organization’s overall fall incident  rate, and develops a plan of action to  address this need that involves  soliciting recommendations concerning  this issue from its staff and contracted  resources (for example, pharmacists,  physicians, social workers,  

transportation providers, and PTs). This  plan of action is collaborative because it  involves input from staff and IDT  members with experience and  

knowledge, and it is interdisciplinary  because those individuals have different  skills, levels of education and  

professional backgrounds and different  perspectives on how to improve the fall  rate. We explained in the proposed rule  that we believed requiring a  

collaborative and interdisciplinary  quality improvement plan will help POs  identify and improve PACE quality  issues more appropriately. Therefore,  we proposed to revise paragraph (a) to  require a PO to have a written quality  improvement plan that is collaborative  and interdisciplinary in nature.  

3\. Additional Quality Assessment  Activities (§ 460.140)  

As discussed in section III.I.1. of this  final rule, we proposed to redesignate  the content of § 460.140 to § 460.130,  and therefore, we proposed to remove  § 460.140.    
The following is a summary of the  public comments we received on the  proposed changes to the quality  requirements in subpart H and our  responses to comments.    
*Comment:* We only received    
comments on the proposed revision to  § 460.132. The many comments we  received were all in favor of the  proposed revision. Commenters  believed that the term ‘‘collaborative  and interdisciplinary in nature’’  accurately describes the quality  improvement plans that POs have under  the current requirements. One  

commenter recommended that CMS also  require POs to solicit ongoing collective  input from individuals and their  families and caregivers when  

developing quality improvement plans.  Another commenter urged CMS to put  additional protections in place to ensure  that any quality improvement plan is  comprehensive and accounts for care  provided across the ‘‘care’’ continuum  and in various settings.    
*Response:* We appreciate the    
comments and are finalizing the

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25649**  

modifications to § 460.132 and the other  changes to subpart H as proposed.  

Regarding the two recommendations we  received on quality improvement plans,  we will take this input into account as  we consider future subregulatory  

guidance or rulemaking on PACE    
quality requirements.  

*J. Subpart I—Participant Enrollment  and Disenrollment*  

1\. Eligibility to Enroll in a PACE    
Program (§ 460.150)  

In accordance with sections 1894(a)(5)  and (c)(1) and 1934(a)(5) and (c)(1) of  the Act, we established § 460.150 to  specify the requirements for eligibility  to enroll in a PACE program.  

Section 460.150(c)(1) provides that, at  the time of enrollment, an individual  must be able to live in a community  setting without jeopardizing his or her  health or safety, and § 460.150(c)(2)  states that the eligibility criteria used to  determine whether an individual’s  

health or safety would be jeopardized by  living in a community setting must be  specified in the program agreement. As  we explained in the proposed rule (81  FR 54687\) and the 2006 final rule (71 FR  71309), determining whether an  

individual’s health or safety would be  jeopardized by living in the community  involves assessing the individual’s care  support network, as well as the  

individual’s health condition. This    
assessment is done by the PO based  upon criteria established by the state  and specified in the PACE program  

agreement. We proposed to codify this  longstanding policy in our regulations  by revising § 460.150(c)(2) to include a  reference to the SAA criteria used to  

determine if an individual’s health or  safety would be jeopardized by living in  a community setting, to indicate that  these criteria are developed by the SAA.  

A discussion of the public comments  we received on this proposal, and our  responses to those comments, appears  below.  

*Comment:* Several commenters    
expressed support for our proposal to  codify the longstanding policy of using  criteria developed by the SAA to  

determine if an individual’s health or  safety would be jeopardized by living in  a community setting. Another  

commenter recommended that we    
develop a new PACE eligibility criterion  for individuals who are institutionalized  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
but have a realistic potential to return to  their homes. Another commenter  

requested that CMS work with states to  ensure that SAA criteria are sufficiently  clear, so as to ensure consistent  

application.  

*Response:* We thank the commenters  for their support. We did not propose  any additional criteria for PACE  eligibility, and therefore, we believe the  comment regarding development of a  new PACE eligibility criterion is outside  of the scope of this regulation. With  regard to the request for us to work with  states to ensure that the SAA criteria  they develop are clear, we believe that  since the states are responsible for  developing the criteria, it is also the  states’ responsibility to ensure the  criteria are sufficiently clear.    
*Comment:* One commenter requested  that in developing the final rule we take  into consideration the systems and  protocols implemented by states to  process PACE eligibility determinations  and that we allow for flexibility in our  requirements and accommodate the  various state protocols, some of which  may provide beneficiary protections in  addition to what CMS requires.    
*Response:* We did not propose any  changes to the requirements for  determining eligibility for PACE, and  therefore, we believe this comment is  outside of the scope of this regulation.  We are finalizing this provision as  proposed.  

2\. Enrollment Process (§ 460.152)  

Section 460.152 specifies the PO’s  responsibilities during the intake  process and actions required in the  event a potential PACE participant is  denied enrollment because his or her  health or safety would be jeopardized by  living in a community setting. Section  460.152(b)(4) states that the PO must  notify CMS and the SAA if a  

prospective participant is denied  enrollment because his or her health or  safety would be jeopardized by living in  a community setting and make the  documentation available for review. We  proposed to add language to paragraph  (b)(4) to require that such notification be  in the form and manner specified by  CMS, as this would reflect our current  practice of requiring POs to provide  these notifications to CMS and the SAA  electronically.    
We received no comments on our  proposal to require that notification to  CMS and the SAA be in the form and  manner specified by us; therefore, we  are finalizing this provision as  

proposed.  

3\. Enrollment Agreement (§ 460.154)  

Section 460.154 specifies the general  content requirements for the enrollment  agreement. Section 460.154(i) states that  the enrollment agreement must contain  a notification that enrollment in PACE  results in disenrollment from any other  Medicare or Medicaid prepayment plan    
or optional benefit. It further provides  that electing enrollment in any other  Medicare or Medicaid prepayment plan  or optional benefit after enrolling as a  PACE participant is considered a  voluntary disenrollment from PACE. We  explained in the proposed rule that we  were concerned about possible  misinterpretations of this provision, and  therefore, we proposed to add language  to paragraph (i) to state that if a  Medicaid-only or private pay PACE  participant becomes eligible for  Medicare after enrollment in PACE, he  or she will be disenrolled from PACE if  he or she elects to obtain Medicare  coverage other than from his or her PO.    
A discussion of the public comment  we received on this proposal, and our  response to this comment, appears  below.    
*Comment:* One commenter expressed  support for our proposal and urged us  to ensure that messaging regarding the  potential for disenrollment be clear and  easy to understand in PACE participant  materials.    
*Response:* We thank the commenter  for its support. We will take the  suggestion regarding clear messaging  into consideration when developing  additional subregulatory guidance on  PACE disenrollment and beneficiary  protections. We are finalizing this  provision as proposed.  

4\. Other Enrollment Procedures  (§ 460.156)  

Section 460.156 specifies the    
documentation and information that a  PO must provide to a PACE participant  who signs an enrollment agreement, as  

well as to CMS and the SAA. Sections  § 460.156(a)(2) and § 460.156(a)(4) state  that, after the participant signs an  enrollment agreement, the PO must give  the participant a PACE membership  card and stickers for his or her Medicare  and Medicaid cards, as applicable,  which indicate that he or she is a PACE  participant and include the phone  number of the PO, respectively. We  proposed to delete the sticker  

requirement currently at § 460.156(a)(4)  and revise the PACE membership card  requirement at § 460.156(a)(2) so the PO  would give the participant a PACE  membership card that indicates that he  or she is a PACE participant and that  includes the phone number of the PO.  As we noted in the proposed rule, this  would not only ensure that the  participant’s Medicare and Medicaid  cards are not damaged if stickers are  removed in the event the participant  disenrolls from PACE, but also would  save participants from having to carry  their Medicare and Medicaid cards with  them, a practice we generally discourage

based on the risk that a beneficiary’s  personal information may be lost or  exposed.    
A discussion of the public comments  we received on this proposal, and our  responses to those comments, appears  below.    
*Comment:* Commenters were    
generally supportive of our proposal to  delete the sticker requirement and  

revise the PACE membership card    
requirement. One commenter stated that  this change may result in POs having to  reissue all PACE membership cards,  which could impose additional  

administrative burdens on the POs.  *Response:* We appreciate the  

commenters’ support for this change.  With regard to the potential for  

additional administrative burden, we  note that this change relieves POs of the  requirement to produce and distribute  additional materials (that is, the  

stickers) for participants’ Medicare and  Medicaid cards. Moreover, POs are  

already required to provide PACE    
membership cards. While the new    
requirement to include the PO’s phone  number on the PACE membership card  will affect some POs that do not  

currently include contact information  on their cards, we believe most POs  include this information already.  

Further, the elimination of the sticker  requirement will lessen ongoing burden  and costs for POs. Therefore, we are  finalizing this provision without  

modification.    
*Comment:* One commenter requested  that CMS revise the enrollment effective  date requirement in § 460.158 to enable  enrollment to become effective on the  date of the signed enrollment  

agreement. The commenter stated that  the current enrollment period (effective  the first day of the calendar month  

following the date of the executed    
enrollment agreement) causes delays in  obtaining PACE services and PACE  participant and family dissatisfaction.    
*Response:* Consistent with the PACE  Protocol (64 FR 66300), we established  in § 460.158 that a participant’s  

enrollment in the program is effective  the first day of the calendar month  

following the date the PO receives the  signed enrollment agreement. We did  not propose any changes to § 460.158 in  the proposed rule, and therefore, we  believe this comment about revising the  enrollment agreement effective date is  outside the scope of this rule. In  

addition, we note that enrollment of  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
individuals and payment to POs is    
based on whole calendar months. In  other words, Medicare and Medicaid  capitation payments are paid to a PO for  an entire month and are not pro-rated.  Medicare and Medicaid capitation  

payment in whole month increments is  consistent with the requirement that  enrollment in a PO is always effective  on the first calendar day of a month and  disenrollment is always effective on the  last calendar day of a month. Given that  both enrollment and Medicare and  Medicaid payment occur in whole  month increments, we would be unable  to accommodate such a request for a  change to § 460.158.  

5\. Voluntary Disenrollment (§ 460.162)  

In accordance with sections    
1894(c)(5)(A) and 1934(c)(5)(A) of the  Act, § 460.162 states that a PACE  participant may voluntarily disenroll  without cause from the program at any  time. We proposed to retain this  language in new paragraph (b) and add  new paragraphs (a) and (c). As described  previously in our discussion of  proposed changes to § 460.112(c)(3), we  have operationalized the statutory  requirements regarding voluntary  disenrollment by allowing participants  to provide notice of voluntary  

disenrollment at any time and making  that disenrollment effective on the first  day of the month after the PO receives  the notice. To align with the proposed  

changes in § 460.112(c)(3) and our  current practices for Medicare health  plan disenrollment, in paragraph (a), we  proposed to add language stating that a  participant’s voluntary disenrollment is  effective on the first day of the month  following the date the PO receives the  participant’s notice of voluntary  disenrollment.    
Sections 1894(c)(5)(A) and    
1934(c)(5)(A) of the Act state that  enrollment and disenrollment of PACE  program eligible individuals in a PACE  program must be under regulations and  the PACE program agreement with  certain statutory restrictions. Moreover,  sections 1894(b)(1)(A)(i) and  

1934(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act state that,  under the PACE program agreement, a  PO must provide all items and services  covered under titles XVIII (Medicare)  and XIX (Medicaid). As we stated in the  proposed rule, through record review  during on-site audits and follow-up  regarding family or participant  grievances and complaints, we have  encountered some instances in which a  participant needed additional services  and was encouraged to voluntarily  disenroll by either an employee or a  contractor of the PO in an effort to  reduce costs for the PO. To help prevent  this practice, we proposed to  

affirmatively require at § 460.162(c) that  POs ensure their employees or  contractors do not engage in any  practice that would reasonably be  expected to have the effect of steering or    
encouraging disenrollment of PACE  participants due to a change in health  status. We noted in the proposed rule  that, under § 460.40(c), a PO would be  subject to sanctions for engaging in this  type of behavior—that is, discriminating  in disenrollment among Medicare or  Medicaid beneficiaries on the basis of  an individual’s health status or need for  health care services.    
A discussion of the public comments  we received on our voluntary  

disenrollment proposals, and our  responses to those comments, appears  below.    
*Comment:* One commenter requested  that we create an exception to the  voluntary disenrollment effective date  for participants electing the Medicare  hospice benefit and allow voluntary  disenrollments for those individuals to  be effective prior to the first day of the  month following the date the PO  receives the participant’s notice of  voluntary disenrollment. The  

commenter stated that the current  requirement may delay the start of  hospice services and can lead to  dissatisfaction for participants and their  family members.    
*Response:* Enrollment of individuals  and payment to POs is based on whole  calendar months. In other words,  Medicare and Medicaid capitation  payments are paid to a PO for an entire  month and are not pro-rated. Medicare  and Medicaid capitation payment in  whole month increments is consistent  with the requirement that enrollment in  a PO is always effective on the first  calendar day of a month and  

disenrollment is always effective on the  last calendar day of a month. Given that  both enrollment and Medicare and  Medicaid payment occur in whole  month increments, we are unable to  accommodate the request for an  exception for participants electing the  Medicare hospice benefit. Therefore, we  are finalizing the proposed change to  § 460.162(a) without such an exception.    
*Comment:* Several commenters  opposed the proposal to revise § 460.162  to specify that a participant’s voluntary  disenrollment is effective on the first  day of the month following the date the  PO receives the participant’s notice of  voluntary disenrollment. The  

commenters requested that we retain the  current regulation, which simply states  that a PACE participant may voluntarily  disenroll from the program without  cause at any time. One commenter  expressed concern that states’  

enrollment and disenrollment systems  may not allow for disenrollment from a  PACE program to be effective the first  day of the following month if notice is  given beyond a certain day of the  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00042 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25651**  

month. This commenter stated that    
while it is possible to disenroll a    
Medicare-only beneficiary effective the  first day of the month following  

notification, disenrollment of Medicaid only and dual-eligible PACE  

participants involves states’ Medicaid  systems, which may require notification  to be provided in advance of a ‘‘cutoff  date’’ in order for a disenrollment to be  effective the first day of the following  month. In these situations, the  

commenter stated, disenrollment    
requests received from Medicaid-only  and dual-eligible PACE participants  after a cutoff date may be delayed until  the first day of the second month  

following receipt.  

*Response:* We note that sections    
1894(c)(5)(A) and 1934(c)(5)(A) of the  Act state that PACE participants shall be  permitted to voluntarily disenroll  

without cause at any time. After    
carefully considering the commenters’  concerns, we respectfully disagree that  concerns about state enrollment and  disenrollment systems outweigh the  need to protect participants by requiring  POs to effectuate participant requests for  disenrollment from the PO in an  

expeditious manner. While we    
appreciate the commenter’s concern  about state systems, we believe that it  would be inappropriate to require that  some PACE participants who wish to  leave PACE remain enrolled for an  

additional month because of the    
inability of a state Medicaid agency to  react to the participant’s request in a  timely manner. Delaying the effective  date of a valid disenrollment request  should not be the course of action when  a participant’s request for disenrollment  is received toward the end of a month.  We also note that imposing an early  cutoff date creates unnecessary delays  for participants who do not have  

Medicaid, even though the processing of  their request does not involve any of the  state systems issues described by the  commenter. We believe establishing a  policy of differing disenrollment  

effective dates based on PACE    
participants’ eligibility for Medicaid and  when they choose to submit the  

disenrollment request to the PO, would  be challenging for POs to successfully  implement and potentially confusing to  participants. We also believe it would  result in inequitable treatment among  PACE participants. We further note that  MA organizations and Medicare PDP  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
sponsors have a longstanding    
requirement to effectuate voluntary  disenrollment requests on the first day  of the following month, regardless of  when the request is received during the  month or whether the beneficiary is  

eligible for Medicaid. We have  operationalized this requirement for  PACE by allowing participants to  provide notice of voluntary  

disenrollment at any time and making  that disenrollment effective on the first  day of the month after the PO receives  

the notice. We believe that Medicare  participants who have chosen to receive  their Medicare health and drug benefits  through PACE, instead of through an  MA plan or a Medicare PDP, should not  have their disenrollment delayed solely  because they submit their request for  disenrollment in the latter part of a  month.    
*Comment:* One commenter expressed  support for the proposed requirement  that POs ensure their employees or  contractors do not steer or encourage  disenrollment of PACE participants due  to a change in health status. In addition,  this commenter requested that we add  ‘‘functional, cognitive, or psychosocial’’  as health status changes for which  disenrollment should not be  

encouraged. In support of the comment,  the commenter referenced the  

expansion of the non-discrimination  provisions contained within  

§ 460.40(a)(3) to include prohibitions on  discrimination on the basis of  

‘‘functional, cognitive, or psychosocial  status.’’    
*Response:* We appreciate the    
comment and agree that these sections  of the PACE regulations should be  consistent. However, as we explain in  our discussion of § 460.40(a)(3) in  section III.E.1 of this final rule, we  inadvertently included the reference to  ‘‘functional, cognitive, or psychosocial  status’’ in the proposed rule and have  restored the current language in this  final rule. While we may consider  revising the description of health status  in future rulemaking, we are not doing  so in this rule, and the reference to  ‘‘health status’’ will remain in both  § 460.40 and § 460.162. Therefore, we  are finalizing this proposed change to  § 460.162(c) without modification.  

6\. Involuntary Disenrollment (§ 460.164)  

Section 460.164 specifies the    
conditions under which a PACE  participant can be involuntarily  disenrolled from a PACE program. The  reasons for involuntary disenrollment  are derived from sections 1894(c)(5)(B)  and 1934(c)(5)(B) of the Act, additional  statutory requirements (for example, the  PACE program agreement is not  renewed, or the participant no longer  meets the state Medicaid nursing facility  level of care requirements), and the  PACE Protocol. We proposed to  redesignate paragraphs (a) through (e) as  paragraphs (b) through (f) and to add    
new paragraph (a) that specifies that a  participant’s disenrollment occurs after  the PO meets the requirements in this  section and is effective on the first day  of the next month that begins 30 days  after the day the PO sends notice of the  disenrollment to the participant. For  example, if a PO sends a disenrollment  notice on April 5, the disenrollment  would be effective June 1–30 days after  April 5 is May 5, and the first day of the  next month after May 5 is June 1\. We  proposed to add this requirement to  make it clear when a participant’s  involuntary disenrollment is effective.  Additionally, we proposed to add this  requirement to protect participants’ due  process, as our regulations and guidance  do not currently include an advance  notice requirement. We noted in the  proposed rule that the PO must not send  the disenrollment notice until the SAA  has reviewed the involuntary  

disenrollment and determined that the  PO has adequately documented  acceptable grounds for disenrollment, as  required by current paragraph (e)  (proposed paragraph (f)). We stated that  we believed 30 days would provide  sufficient time for an individual to  gather documentation, medical records,  or other information in order to respond  to the PO’s proposed disenrollment  action, should he or she disagree.  Without the 30 days of advance notice,  we noted in the proposed rule, a PO  could notify a participant about an  involuntary disenrollment late in the  month and make the effective date of  the involuntary disenrollment the first  day of the following month, only a few  days later. This would not allow  sufficient time for a participant to  contest the disenrollment or to  effectively coordinate a transition to  other care and services.  

Section 460.164(a) currently states the  reasons a participant may be  

involuntarily disenrolled from PACE.  Paragraph (a)(1) states that the PO may  involuntarily disenroll a participant for  failing to pay, or to make satisfactory  arrangements to pay, any premium due  the PO after a 30-day grace period. As  noted previously, we proposed to  redesignate (a)(1) as (b)(1) and  

restructure the sentence to clarify that  the 30-day grace period applies to both  failure to pay and failure to make  satisfactory arrangements to pay any  premium due the PO. We explained in  the proposed rule that we proposed the  change because we believed the current  sentence structure creates confusion as  to whether the grace period applies to  both payment of the premium ‘‘and’’  making satisfactory arrangements to  pay. We noted that the revision would

**25652 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

clarify that an involuntary    
disenrollment cannot be initiated due to  a participant’s failure to pay until after  a 30-day grace period for the participant  to pay or to make satisfactory  

arrangements to pay. Satisfactory    
arrangements could be, for example, a  participant’s agreement to pay through  installments, or agreement to pay within  a specific time period.  

We also proposed to redesignate    
paragraphs (a)(2) to (a)(6) as (b)(4) to  (b)(8) and to add two additional reasons  for involuntary disenrollment in new  paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3). In  

paragraph (b)(2), we proposed new    
language that would permit involuntary  disenrollment if the participant, after a  30-day grace period, fails to pay or make  satisfactory arrangements to pay any  applicable Medicaid spend-down  

liability or any amount due under the  post-eligibility treatment of income  processes as permitted under § 460.182  and § 460.184. Section 1934(i) of the  Act, as well as §§ 460.182(c), 460.184,  460.152 and 460.154 pertain to these  payment amounts. Under section  

1934(i) of the Act and § 460.184(a), a  state may provide for post-eligibility  treatment of income for participants in  the same manner as a state treats post eligibility income for individuals  

receiving services under a Medicaid  waiver under section 1915(c) of the Act.  Section 460.182(c)(1) requires that the  PO accept the Medicaid capitation  

payment as payment in full ‘‘except’’ for  payment with respect to spend-down  liability and post-eligibility treatment of  income. Section 460.152(a)(1)(iv) and  (v) requires that PACE staff explain  

specific information to the potential  participant and his or her representative  or caregiver, including any Medicaid  spend-down obligation and post 

eligibility treatment of income. Section  460.154(g) requires that a participant  who is Medicaid eligible or a dual  

eligible be notified and required to    
acknowledge in writing that he or she  may be liable for any applicable spend down liability and amount due under  

the post-eligibility treatment of income  process. We explained in the proposed  rule that, operationally, a PO needs the  ability to involuntarily disenroll  

participants based on nonpayment of  these amounts. We noted that  

participants are obligated to pay these  amounts as part of the PO’s overall  

reimbursement for care and services  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
provided through the program.    
Moreover, we stated that we understood  that a participant’s failure to pay these  amounts can have a significant financial  impact on the PO. Continued  

insufficient reimbursement to the PO on  

an ongoing basis could affect the PO’s  financial viability and its ability to  continue operations. We explained that  we have previously addressed this issue  for many POs through approval of  waivers, but we believed addressing it  through a regulatory change is more  efficient and is permitted under the  PACE statutory authority. Moreover, we  noted, as with any involuntary  disenrollment, an involuntary  

disenrollment based on nonpayment of  applicable Medicaid spend-down  liability or any amount due under the  post-eligibility treatment of income  process must be reviewed by the SAA  to determine that the PO has adequately  documented acceptable grounds for  disenrollment before it becomes  effective.    
In paragraph (b)(3), we proposed to  add language that would permit  involuntary disenrollment in situations  where the participant’s caregiver  engages in disruptive or threatening  behavior. We also proposed to  

redesignate current paragraphs (b)(1)  and (b)(2) as paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and  (c)(1)(ii), respectively, and to add new  paragraph (c)(2) to describe what we  consider to be disruptive or threatening  behavior of a participant’s caregiver.    
Specifically, we proposed that a PACE  participant may be involuntarily  disenrolled from the PO if a  

participant’s caregiver engages in  disruptive or threatening behavior that  jeopardizes the participant’s health or  safety, or the safety of the caregiver or  others. We noted in the proposed rule  that this would include any family  member involved in the participant’s  care. We stated that we believed  sections 1894(c)(5)(B) and 1934(c)(5)(B)  of the Act, which state that a PO may  not disenroll a participant except for  engaging in disruptive or threatening  behavior, as defined in such regulations  (developed in close consultation with  SAAs), could be read to include a  caregiver. We also noted that the PACE  Protocol listed as a basis for involuntary  disenrollment that the participant  ‘‘experiences a breakdown in the  physician and/or team-participant  relationship such that the PO’s ability to  furnish services to either the participant  or other participants is seriously  impaired,’’ which we believed could  include disruptive or threatening  behavior of a caregiver (64 FR 66300).    
We explained in the proposed rule  that, although we previously stated in  the 2006 final rule (71 FR 71316\) that  we would not include as a basis for  disenrollment the disruptive or  threatening behavior of family members  that are involved in the participant’s  care, as we gained more experience with    
PACE, we realized that it is not always  possible for a PO to establish alternative  arrangements that would not disrupt the  PO’s ability to provide adequate services  to the participant in situations where  the caregiver is engaging in threatening  or disruptive behavior. We noted in the  proposed rule that, given the variety of  settings in which POs provide services,  including the PACE center and the  participant’s home, there may be  situations where the caregiver’s  disruptive or threatening behavior  jeopardizes the health or safety of the  participant, other PACE participants,  staff, or visitors and it is not be feasible  to establish alternative arrangements.  We stated that we have already  approved waivers for involuntary  disenrollment, several of which address  disruptive or threatening caregiver  behavior. The requests for waivers have  come from POs that have experienced  situations in which their ability to safely  and effectively care for participants is  potentially compromised by the  behavior of the participant’s caregiver  that jeopardizes the health or safety of  others including other participants,  staff, or visitors. We noted in the  proposed rule that the proposed  revision would obviate the need for  those waivers, thereby reducing the  burden on POs, states, and CMS.  

We emphasized in the proposed rule  that a PO must only pursue involuntary  disenrollment of a participant based on  a caregiver’s behavior after it has  engaged in efforts to resolve the  situation and has documented all of  those efforts. As set forth in current  paragraph (e) (proposed paragraph (f)),  all involuntary disenrollments require a  review and final determination by the  SAA before they can become effective,  so as to ensure that the PO has  adequately documented acceptable  grounds for disenrollment. As set forth  in § 460.168, when a PACE participant  is disenrolled from the PO, the PO must  facilitate a participant’s enrollment into  other Medicare or Medicaid programs  for which the participant is eligible and  must make sure medical records are  available to the new providers. We  explained in the proposed rule that this  will help ensure that the participant  receives needed care. We noted that we  did not propose a similar change to  § 460.164(b)(2) (proposed paragraph  (c)(2)), which refers to involuntary  disenrollment of a participant with  decision-making capacity who  consistently refuses to comply with his  or her individual plan of care or the  terms of the PACE enrollment  

agreement. A PO cannot involuntarily  disenroll a participant based on the

caregiver’s noncompliance with the  participant’s plan of care or terms of the  PACE enrollment agreement.    
A discussion of the public comments  we received on our involuntary  

disenrollment proposals, and our    
responses to those comments, appears  below.    
*Comment:* Two commenters    
expressed support for our proposed  clarification of the effective date of an  involuntary disenrollment and the new  proposed requirement for advance  

notice of the disenrollment. Another  commenter expressed general support  for these proposals but requested that  we waive the 30-day advance notice  requirement when a PACE participant is  out of the PO’s service area for more  than 30 days without giving prior notice  to the PO or obtaining approval from the  PO.    
*Response:* We appreciate the    
commenters’ support for our proposals;  however, we do not believe it would be  appropriate to waive the advance notice  

requirement in circumstances where a  participant is out of the PO’s service  area for a specified time period. We  believe the proposed requirement to  notify a participant in advance of the  PO’s decision to involuntarily disenroll  the participant is an important  

protection for all participants, and while  we agree that a participant’s temporary  absence from the service area may raise  coverage challenges, we are concerned  the lack of advance notice would result  in some erroneous disenrollments, given  that the participant may not have an  opportunity to address any  

misunderstanding as to the participant’s  location before the disenrollment takes  effect. In the absence of a requirement  for advance notice, a PO potentially  could issue a disenrollment notice on  the last day of month and effectuate the  disenrollment the next day. We also  note that beneficiaries enrolled in MA  plans, Medicare PDPs and Medicare cost  plans are provided advance notice of an  involuntary disenrollment. We believe  that Medicare participants who have  chosen to receive their Medicare health  and drug benefits through PACE,  

instead of through an MA plan,    
Medicare PDP, or Medicare cost plan  should have the same protection that  advance notice of involuntary  

disenrollment affords.    
*Comment:* One commenter    
recommended that CMS consider    
incorporating into the PACE regulations  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
the grievance and appeals processes  available to Medicaid managed care  beneficiaries in involuntary  

disenrollment situations.    
*Response:* While there are some    
similarities between the regulatory  

requirements for Medicaid managed  care and PACE, they are not completely  aligned with regard to how grievances  and appeals are defined. We have  established specific requirements for  PACE regarding grievances (defined in  § 460.120 as a complaint expressing  dissatisfaction with service delivery or  the quality of care furnished) and  appeals (defined in § 460.122 as a  participant’s action taken with respect  to the PO’s noncoverage of, or  

nonpayment for, a service). Moreover,  we have specified the limited reasons  that a participant may be involuntarily  disenrolled from PACE in § 460.164,  and we require that before an  

involuntary disenrollment is effective,  the SAA must review and determine in  a timely manner that the PO has  adequately documented acceptable  grounds for the disenrollment. The state  must provide an appeal avenue for both  Medicaid and non-Medicaid  

participants related to involuntary  disenrollments. Since Medicare-only  participants do not have access to the  State Fair Hearings process, states must  develop an administrative review  process for PACE participants who are  not eligible for Medicaid to address  appeals of involuntary disenrollments.  And while the PACE regulations do not  require the PO to establish an appeal  process for an involuntary  

disenrollment, they are not prohibited  from doing so. Because PACE already  requires prior state review of a proposed  involuntary disenrollment, as well as an  avenue of resolution in response to a  PO’s action to involuntary disenroll a  participant, we do not believe it is  necessary to incorporate additional  protections based on Medicaid managed  care requirements.  

*Comment:* One commenter expressed  concern about the potential for POs to  involuntarily disenroll participants  considered ‘‘difficult to serve’’ based on  the actions of their caregivers. However,  the commenter noted that its concerns  are mitigated by the expanded anti discrimination protections proposed in  § 460.40. The same commenter stated  that PACE participants should not be  held responsible for the actions of their  caregivers unless the participant is  involved to some extent in the  disruptive behavior. Two commenters  requested that we provide guidance to  POs for instances in which a caregiver’s  behavior is viewed as potentially  jeopardizing the health or safety of the  participant, or the safety of others.  Another commenter opposed  

involuntary disenrollment based on  caregiver behavior, viewing such action  as punitive to the participant and    
creating the potential for adverse health  and safety issues. This commenter  requested that POs be directed to find  alternative arrangements instead of  disenrolling the participant.    
*Response:* We do not believe that  involuntary disenrollment based on the  disruptive behavior of a caregiver or  family member should be contingent  upon the involvement or encouragement  of the participant. Due to the type of  individual eligible for and enrolled in a  PO (that is, frail elderly meeting a  nursing home level of care) and the type  of services needed, there is a greater  prevalence of involvement by caregivers  in most aspects of the participant’s care.  In addition, there may be participants  who are entirely dependent on a  caregiver or family member to obtain or  arrange for care or services, leading to  a greater potential for disruptive or  threatening behavior on the part of the  caregiver that hinders the PO’s ability to  provide services to the participant or to  others or potentially jeopardizes the  health or safety of the participant, or the  safety of others. We believe such  instances, while rare, may necessitate  the involuntary disenrollment of the  participant for the safety of the  participant, the caregiver or others. We  note that all PO requests for involuntary  disenrollment due to disruptive or  threatening behavior are reviewed for  appropriateness by the SAA prior to the  disenrollment occurring. We expect the  PO to take appropriate action in a  manner consistent with the legal  requirements applicable to the  jurisdictions in which it operates,  including state laws relating to  mandatory reporting of elder abuse,  whenever abuse or neglect of a  participant may have occurred. We  expect POs to attempt alternative  arrangements; however, as we stated in  the proposed rule, we understand that is  not always possible. We thank the  commenters for their concern.  

Subsequent to the publication of this  final rule, we will provide guidance to  POs for instances in which a caregiver’s  behavior is viewed as potentially  jeopardizing the health or safety of the  participant, or the safety of others.    
Regarding the comment referring to  expanded anti-discrimination  

protections, as we discussed previously  in sections III.E.1 of this final rule, we  inadvertently included a reference to  ‘‘functional, cognitive, or psychosocial  status’’ in § 460.40(a)(3) in the proposed  rule, even though our intention was  solely to redesignate the paragraph, and  we have restored the existing language  in this final rule.    
*Comment:* One commenter requested  that we establish a process for expedited

**25654 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

SAA review of a PO’s request for    
involuntary disenrollment on the basis  of threatening or disruptive behavior  and that this process not exceed 30  

days. The same commenter suggested  that CMS provide advance notice to  PACE participants when an involuntary  disenrollment request is filed with the  SAA and that the PO begin transferring  the participant to fee-for-service (that is,  non-PACE) providers pending final SAA  determination.  

*Response:* We agree that advance    
notification to participants of the    
potential for involuntary disenrollment  based on caregiver behavior may be  helpful; however, we did not propose a  new requirement for a notice that would  be issued to the participant when the  PO submits a request for involuntary  disenrollment to the SAA. We also did  not propose the creation of a new option  for an expedited SAA review of requests  for involuntary disenrollment or a new  process in which participants are  

transferred to non-PACE providers prior  to the SSA approving the request for  involuntary disenrollment. While we  believe these recommendations are  

outside the scope of this rule, we will  take these comments under  

consideration for future subregulatory  guidance or rulemaking.  

*Comment:* Commenters were    
supportive of our proposal to include as  a basis for involuntary disenrollment  the disruptive or threatening behavior of  family members that are involved in the  participant’s care and involuntary  

disenrollment based on nonpayment of  applicable Medicaid spend-down  

liability or any amount due under the  post-eligibility treatment of income  process.  

*Response:* We appreciate the support  expressed by the commenters to  

establish these additional bases for    
involuntary disenrollment. After    
considering the comments, we are    
finalizing those proposed changes, as  well as our other involuntary  

disenrollment proposals without    
modification.  

7\. Effective Date of Disenrollment    
(§ 460.166)  

Section 460.166 is currently titled    
‘‘Effective date of disenrollment;’’    
however, it focuses on the PO’s    
responsibilities when disenrolling a  participant. Therefore, we proposed to  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
change the title to ‘‘Disenrollment    
responsibilities’’ to better describe the  subject of this section.  

We received no comments on this    
proposal, and therefore, we are    
finalizing it without modification.  

8\. Reinstatement in Other Medicare and  Medicaid Programs (§ 460.168)  

Section 460.168 describes the PO’s  responsibility to facilitate a participant’s  reinstatement in other Medicare and  Medicaid programs after disenrollment.  Section 460.168(a) states that a PO must  make appropriate referrals and ensure  that medical records are made available  to new providers in a ‘‘timely manner.’’  To ensure POs interpret ‘‘timely  manner’’ uniformly, we proposed to  change ‘‘in a timely manner’’ to ‘‘within  30 days,’’ which would help ensure a  smooth transition for participants. We  proposed 30 days because we believed  this would balance the need to give the  PO adequate time to gather the medical  records, make copies, and deliver them  to the new providers with the need to  ensure that new providers receive the  medical records as soon as possible to  help ensure a smooth transition for the  participant and continued access to  medications and other needed ongoing  care.    
*Comment:* One commenter expressed  support for our proposal to require POs  to make appropriate referrals and ensure  medical records are made available to  new providers ‘‘within 30 days,’’ as  opposed to in a ‘‘timely manner.’’  Another commenter requested that we  clarify the actions to which the  proposed timeframe refers.    
*Response:* We did not propose any  changes to the actions the PO must take  to facilitate a participant’s reinstatement  in other Medicare and Medicaid  programs after disenrollment. We  believe the actions to which the 30-day  timeframe applies are adequately  specified in the regulation; just as the  current timeliness requirement applies  to both making appropriate referrals and  ensuring medical records are made  available to new providers, the PO will  be expected to carry out both of those  actions ‘‘within 30 days’’ once the final  rule takes effect. We are finalizing this  provision as proposed.  

*K. Subpart J—Payment*  

1\. Medicaid Payment (§ 460.182)  

Section 1934(d) of the Act requires a  state to make prospective monthly  capitated payments for each PACE  program participant eligible for medical  assistance under the state plan. The  capitation payment amount must be  specified in the PACE program  agreement and be less, taking into  account the frailty of PACE participants,  than the amount that would otherwise  have been paid under the state plan if  the individuals were not enrolled in a  PACE program. As we explained in the  proposed rule, there is no national    
Medicaid rate-setting methodology for  PACE; rather, each state that elects  PACE as a Medicaid state plan option  must develop a payment amount based  on the cost of comparable services for  the state’s nursing facility-eligible  population. Generally, the amounts are  based on a blend of the cost of nursing  home and community-based care for the  frail elderly. The monthly capitation  payment amount is negotiated between  the PO and the SAA and can be  renegotiated on an annual basis.    
We implemented the PACE statutory  requirements for Medicaid payment in  § 460.182. Section 460.182(b) states that  the monthly Medicaid capitation  payment is negotiated between the PO  and the SAA and specified in the PACE  program agreement, and the amount  meets certain criteria set forth in  paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4).  Consistent with the revisions to  § 460.32(a)(12), we proposed to revise  § 460.182(b) to require that the PACE  program agreement contain the state’s  Medicaid capitation rate or the  ‘‘methodology’’ for establishing the  Medicaid capitation rates. We explained  in the proposed rule that as a result of  changes to the methods states are using  to determine capitation rates, which can  result in varied payment based on frailty  of the population and performance  incentive payments, we have found that  specifying the capitation amount in the  program agreement is sometimes  operationally impractical. Additionally,  we noted in the proposed rule, because  many states update their PACE  Medicaid capitation rates annually  based on the state fiscal year, there are  operational challenges associated with  updating the PACE program agreement  appendices to reflect changes to the  Medicaid rates. We stated that we  believed providing the option of  including the state’s methodology for  calculating the Medicaid capitation  payment amount is consistent with the  statutory requirement in section  1934(d)(2) of the Act that the program  agreement specify how the PO will be  paid for each Medicaid participant, and  we believed it would result in less  burden for POs, states and CMS by  eliminating the frequency of updates to  the PACE program agreement to reflect  the routine changes to the PACE  Medicaid capitation rates.    
We also proposed to redesignate  paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) as  

paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) and add a  new paragraph (b)(3), which would  require that the monthly capitation  amount paid by the SAA be sufficient  and consistent with efficiency,  economy, and quality of care. Current  paragraph (b)(1) requires that the

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25655**  

Medicaid rate be less than what    
otherwise would have been paid if the  participants were not enrolled in PACE,  which in essence establishes an upper  bound under which the rate must fall.  We explained in the proposed rule that  while current paragraph (b)(2) also  

requires that the rate take into account  the comparative frailty of PACE  

participants, the regulation does not  require that the rate be adequate or  

sufficient to provide the services    
required under the PACE program for  the enrolled population. Since the rate  is only required to be less than what  would have otherwise been paid by  Medicaid outside of PACE, there is no  lower bound for the rate. We noted in  the proposed rule that we proposed the  new language to ensure that the  

Medicaid rate paid under the PACE  program agreement is not only less than  what would otherwise have been paid  outside of PACE for a comparable  

population, but is also sufficient for the  population served under the PACE  

program, which we believed means not  lower than an amount that would be  reasonable and appropriate to enable the  PO to cover the anticipated service  

utilization of the frail elderly    
participants enrolled in the program and  adequate to meet PACE program  

requirements. We proposed that the  monthly capitation amount be  

consistent with efficiency, economy,  and quality of care. We explained in the  proposed rule that, by efficiency and  economy, we meant that the payment  amount must reflect that POs bring more  efficiencies to the administration,  

management and oversight of    
participant care because they are    
singularly responsible for all of a    
participant’s care (including acute and  long term care services), which in many  cases outside of PACE are managed by  multiple provider entities. We noted  that while the efficiencies of providing  and coordinating all of a participant’s  care can result in lower expenditures as  compared to a more fragmented  

payment system with multiple    
providers and entities providing    
different aspects of an individual’s care,  the Medicaid monthly capitation  

amount must also enable the PO to    
ensure participant access to quality care  and services to meet the participant’s  needs. We stated that failure to provide  adequate reimbursement to POs could  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
negatively affect participant care    
through reduced care and service    
authorizations, as well as limit    
resources for the PO to promote program  goals such as quality of care, improved  health, community integration of  

participants, and cost containment,  where feasible.    
Additionally, we solicited comments  about other rate methodologies we may  consider requiring for Medicaid  capitation payment amounts for PACE.  We requested input to determine  whether or not there could be other rate  setting methodologies for PACE that are  more consistent and competitive with  rate setting methodologies used for  other programs that provide similar  services to similar populations on a  capitated basis. We provided as an  example that Medicaid rates for many of  the state financial alignment  

demonstrations require actuarially  sound rates. We noted, however, that  any change to the PACE rate setting  requirements would need to ensure that  the rates are still less than the amount  that would otherwise have been made  under the state plan if individuals were  not enrolled in PACE and be adjusted to  take into account the comparative frailty  of PACE enrollees, which is required  under section 1934(d)(2) of the Act. We  did not propose changes to the rate  methodology for Medicaid capitation  payments, but we stated that we would  use public comment to inform possible  future PACE rulemaking concerning  Medicaid capitation payments.    
The following is a summary of the  public comments we received on the  proposed provisions regarding Medicaid  payment and our responses to  

comments.    
*Comment:* All commenters supported  the proposal to incorporate the state’s  Medicaid rate methodology *or* the  Medicaid rates into the PACE program  agreement instead of requiring the  actual rates. Most commenters  supported the proposal without  reservation. However, one commenter  stated that while the commenter  supports the Medicaid rate methodology  proposal, it seems to remove the  incentive for the state to negotiate the  Medicaid rates in a timely manner.    
*Response:* We appreciate the support  for this proposed change. In response to  the comment expressing concern that  states will have less incentive to update  and negotiate their rates in a timely  manner, we will take this into  

consideration when issuing updated  guidance to states regarding the  Medicaid rate setting process.    
*Comment:* All commenters supported  the proposal to add the requirement that  Medicaid PACE capitation rates be  sufficient and consistent with  

efficiency, economy and quality of care.  However, two commenters  

recommended that CMS use alternate  language instead of ‘‘sufficient’’, such as  ‘‘reasonable and appropriate’’ or    
‘‘reasonable, appropriate and    
attainable’’, which is part of the  standard in § 438.4(a) for actuarially  sound capitation rates in Medicaid  managed care. One commenter  recommended defining ‘‘sufficient’’ in  regulation to mean not lower than an  amount that would be reasonable and  appropriate to enable the PO to cover  the anticipated service utilization of the  frail elderly participants enrolled in the  program and adequate to meet PACE  program requirements. Two commenters  also requested details or guidance on  how the ‘‘lower bound’’ would be  calculated. Two commenters suggested  requiring sufficient language in the rate  method description to enhance  transparency of the Medicaid rate  setting process. Two commenters  recommended requirements to ensure  Medicaid rates take into account the full  financial risk for all Medicaid covered  services, including nursing home care,  without a restriction or adjustment for  length of stay. One commenter  recommended that the final rule  promote use of experience and risk  based methodologies in general, and  support state flexibility in tailoring rate  setting methods to reflect state  circumstances. Another commenter  recommended allowing direct use of  appropriate adjusted experience from  Medicaid managed LTC programs in  addition to or in place of FFS  

experience or PACE experience.  *Response:* We appreciate the overall  support for this proposed change. In  response to the commenter that  recommended we modify language in  the final rule to clarify that rates should  be actuarially sound, we are not able to  require that PACE rates be actuarially  sound because actuarially sound rates  could exceed the amount that was  otherwise paid by the state, if the  individuals were not enrolled in PACE,  and PACE rates are required by statute  to be less than the amount that would  have otherwise been paid if participants  were not in PACE. In response to the  commenters that recommended  alternative language to ‘‘sufficient and  consistent with efficiency, economy and  quality of care’’, which is terminology  that governs Medicaid fee-for-service  payments at section 1902(a)(30)(A) of  the Act, and instead recommended  language consistent with established  standards used in Medicaid managed  care, we agree this standard would be  more appropriate because PACE as a  capitated model is more aligned with  Medicaid managed care than Medicaid  fee-for-service. In response to  

commenters’ concerns regarding  transparency of the state’s rate method,

**25656 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

and that rates take into account the full  financial risk that POs assume, we will  take that into consideration when  

issuing updated guidance to states    
regarding the Medicaid rate setting    
process. In response to the commenter  questioning how the ‘‘lower bound’’  will be defined, we did not intend to  establish or define a specific lower  

bound for PACE Medicaid rates, but  would expect the state to be able to  demonstrate that the Medicaid rates  

comply with regulatory requirements. In  response to the comment regarding state  use of Medicaid managed LTC  

experience in development of PACE  rates, the current regulation requires  that the Medicaid rates be less than the  amount that would otherwise been paid  under the state plan if the participants  were not enrolled in PACE, among other  requirements. That amount is not  

limited to a fee-for-service comparable  population, and states are not  

prohibited from using Medicaid    
managed care data in determining the  amount that would otherwise have been  paid, but they must be able to  

demonstrate that the amount meets the  existing PACE requirements.  

Recognizing that more states will be  using managed care experience for their  comparable population, we will take  that into consideration when issuing  updated guidance to states regarding the  Medicaid rate setting process in PACE.  We appreciate the overall support for  the proposed changes. While we are  finalizing § 460.182(b) to require that  the PACE program agreement contain  the state’s Medicaid capitation rate or  the ‘‘methodology’’ for establishing the  Medicaid capitation rates, we have  

decided not to finalize the proposed  language that rates be sufficient and  consistent with efficiency, economy and  quality of care. However, we appreciate  all of the comments and feedback and  will take this input into account as we  consider any changes during future  rulemaking.  

*Comment:* Regarding alternative rate  methodologies for PACE Medicaid  

payments, some commenters suggested:  Using Grade of Membership  

methodology to identify a long-term care admission cohort; permitting a  ‘‘tiered’’ rate structure that Medicare only individuals would be required to  pay based on services provided under  the program; requiring actuarial  

certification of rates; requiring that rates  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
related to LTSS be consistent across  Medicaid and PACE; and that CMS  

develop a workgroup with stakeholders  including the National PACE  

Association and POs regarding alternate  methods for rate setting. Two comments  

related to the Medicare PACE capitation  amounts and suggested: That Medicare  rates for POs be consistent with  Medicare Medicaid Plans (MMP) or  Dual Special Needs Plans (DSNP) to  create a level playing field; and that  changes to PACE Medicare rates be  made to align with MA rules.    
*Response:* We appreciate the feedback  provided in response to our request for  comments about other rate  

methodologies that may be applied to  PACE Medicaid payments. While we  did not propose changes to the rate  methodology for Medicaid capitation  payments, we will use the public  comments received to inform possible  future PACE rulemaking concerning  Medicaid payment. We did not propose  any changes to the Medicare payment  requirements under § 460.180, and  therefore, we believe the  

recommendations for changes to the  Medicare PACE rates are outside of the  scope of this rule.  

*L. Subpart K—Federal/State Monitoring*  

1\. Monitoring During Trial Period  (§ 460.190) and Ongoing Monitoring  After Trial Period (§ 460.192)  

Sections 1894(e)(4)(A) and    
1934(e)(4)(A) of the Act require the  Secretary, in cooperation with the SAA,  to conduct a comprehensive annual  review of the operation of a PO during  its trial period in order to assure  compliance with the requirements of  sections 1894 and 1934 of the Act and  PACE regulations. The trial period is  defined as the first 3 years of the PO’s  contract with CMS and the SAA.  Sections 1894(e)(4)(A) and 1934(e)(4)(A)  of the Act further provide that the  review must include: An on-site visit; a  comprehensive assessment of the PO’s  fiscal soundness; a comprehensive  assessment of the PO’s capacity to  provide PACE services to all enrolled  participants; a detailed analysis of the  PO’s substantial compliance with all  significant requirements of sections  1894 and 1934 of the Act and PACE  regulations; and any other elements the  Secretary or the SAA considers  necessary or appropriate. Sections  1894(e)(4)(B) and 1934(e)(4)(B) of the  Act provide that the Secretary, in  cooperation with the SAA, must  continue to conduct reviews of the  operation of the PO after the trial period  as may be appropriate, taking into  account the performance level of a PO  and compliance of a PO with all  significant requirements of sections  1894 and 1934 of the Act and PACE  regulations. Sections 1894(e)(4)(C) and  1934(e)(4)(C) of the Act provide that the  results of the reviews must be reported    
promptly to the PO, along with any  recommendations for changes to the  PO’s program, and made available to the  public upon request.    
Sections 460.190 and 460.192 set  forth the requirements for monitoring  during and after the trial period,  respectively. These regulations  currently incorporate requirements from  the PACE Protocol that are more specific  than those provided in statute, in that  § 460.190(b)(1) details specific activities  that must occur onsite during the trial  period reviews, and § 460.192(b)  requires that, after a PO’s trial period  ends, ongoing reviews be conducted  onsite at least every 2 years. We  proposed to revise these provisions of  the existing regulations.    
As we explained in the proposed rule,  in the 15 years since the initial PACE  regulations were established, the PACE  program has flourished and we have  gained significant program experience  with respect to oversight and  

monitoring of POs. We noted in the  proposed rule that we no longer  believed that the activities listed in  § 460.190(b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(v) must  be performed while onsite at the PACE  location; technology affords us the  opportunity to complete these tasks  remotely. For example, we have  implemented the use of webinar  technology in the performance of  similar program audits of Medicare  Advantage organizations and Part D  sponsors. This technology allows the  entity being reviewed to provide CMS  access to information on its computer  systems in real time, in a secure  manner. It also allows reviewers to  interact with the entity being reviewed  and its staff, while not being physically  present in the building with them. We  stated in the proposed rule that the use  of this technology has saved significant  resources in travel dollars and staff  downtime (experienced while they are  traveling). Therefore, we proposed to  delete the list of specific activities that  may be performed as part of an onsite  visit as currently set forth in the  paragraphs located in § 460.190(b)(1)(i)  through (b)(1)(v).    
In addition, we proposed revisions to  the language at § 460.190(b)(1) and a  new paragraph in § 460.190(b)(2) to  more closely mirror the text of statute.  We noted in the proposed rule that the  proposed language retains the obligation  that CMS conduct an onsite visit to  observe the PO’s operations. However, it  affords reviewers the flexibility to  conduct other portions of the review  remotely. We explained that greater  flexibility to conduct portions of the  review remotely would allow our  reviews of POs to gain some of the same  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00048 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25657**  

efficiencies that CMS currently achieves  through the use of web-based  

technologies in other programs.    
Specifically, we proposed in the revised  § 460.190(b)(1) that the trial period  

review include an onsite visit to the PO,  which may include, but is not limited  to, observation of program operations,  and proposed a separate requirement in  the new § 460.190(b)(2) that the trial  period review include a detailed  

analysis of the entity’s substantial    
compliance with all significant    
requirements of sections 1894 and 1934  of the Act and the PACE regulations,  which may include review of marketing,  participant services, enrollment and  disenrollment, and grievances and  

appeals. We proposed to retain the    
language found in current (b)(2), (b)(3),  and (b)(4), but proposed to redesignate  these as (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5).    
Section 460.192(b) of the current    
regulations establishes the obligation for  continued oversight after the trial  

period, including the requirement for an  onsite review of every PO every 2 years.  We explained in the proposed rule that  as the PACE program has grown, and  with it the number of POs, the amount  of resources spent conducting both trial  period and on-going audits of POs has  significantly increased. We stated that  we must balance the responsibilities of  ensuring that all of our beneficiaries are  receiving quality care with our duty to  effectively manage our resources and  ensure proper oversight over all of the  programs we manage. Sections 1893 and  1894 of the Act do not require the  

current level of monitoring.    
Consequently, we noted in the    
proposed rule that we believed that the  frequency of ongoing reviews of POs  beyond their trial period should occur  based on a risk assessment that takes  into account the PO’s performance level  and compliance with the significant  requirements of sections 1834 and 1934  of the Act and the PACE regulations.  Therefore, we proposed to delete the  language in § 460.192(b) that requires  onsite review every 2 years and replace  it with that requirement that CMS, in  cooperation with the SAA, will conduct  reviews of the operations of POs as  

appropriate, by utilizing a risk    
assessment as the means of selecting  which POs will be audited each year.  We stated in the proposed rule that this  risk assessment would rely largely on  the organization’s past performance and  ongoing compliance with CMS and state  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
requirements. However, we proposed  that the risk assessment also take into  account other information that could  

indicate a PO needs to be reviewed,  such as participant complaints or access  to care concerns. This would mirror our  

approach in selecting organizations for  audit in other programs such as the MA  and Part D programs, which is a data  driven, risk-based approach. We noted  that this risk assessment would utilize  important measures specific to PACE, as  determined by us including, but not  limited to, length of time between  audits, past performance, and other data  measures, such as grievances and/or  self-reported adverse events, also known  as PACE Quality Data, as necessary. We  stated that we believe using MA and  Part D is an appropriate model on which  to base PACE audits, because like in MA  and Part D, a PO is responsible for  providing a participant’s benefits in  accordance with our regulations. We  also explained that we have discovered  through the MA and Part D programs  that sponsors have varying degrees of  compliance and that auditing  

organizations based on risk allows CMS  to focus on those organizations that  require closer scrutiny. Similarly,  program experience has shown that POs  also have varying degrees of  

compliance; therefore, we noted that we  believed this will be a useful tool in  selecting organizations for audit and  will allow continued oversight and  monitoring in the PACE program, with  better targeting of resources based on  the relative risk each organization  presents.  

2\. Corrective Action (§ 460.194)  

Section 460.194(a) requires a PO to  take action ‘‘to correct deficiencies  identified during reviews.’’ However, as  we stated in the proposed rule, there has  been some uncertainty as to which  circumstances trigger the requirement  that a PO take action to correct  deficiencies. We proposed to revise this  regulation to clarify for POs the range of  circumstances under which CMS or the  SAAs may identify deficiencies that  would require action by the POs to  correct those deficiencies. We proposed  to change § 460.194(a) to state that a PO  must take action to correct deficiencies  identified by CMS or the SAA as a result  of the following:  

• Ongoing monitoring of the PO;  • Reviews and audits of the PO;  

• Complaints from PACE participants  or caregivers; and  

• Any other instance CMS or the SAA  identifies programmatic deficiencies  requiring correction.  

We proposed this change to specify  that corrective actions will be required  to address deficiencies identified by  CMS or the SAA through any of these  mechanisms.    
3\. Disclosure of Review Results  (§ 460.196)  

As we stated in the proposed rule,  PACE participants are a frail and  vulnerable population, and we  recognized that in some cases they may  be unable to fully grasp the nature of  our review results and use them to make  decisions about their healthcare. Our  reviews measure the PO’s compliance  with a variety of CMS requirements,  such as the ability of the PO to deliver  medically necessary healthcare and  medications to their participants.  Currently, the regulations require that  POs make their review results available  in a location that is readily accessible to  their participants, without mention of  accessibility to other parties. However,  we explained in the proposed rule that  we believed that not only participants  but also their family members,  caregivers, or authorized representatives  should have access to that information  in order to better inform their decisions  about the participants’ healthcare.  Therefore, we proposed to amend  § 460.196(d) to ensure that POs make  review results available for examination  not just by PACE participants, but by  those individuals who may be making  decisions about PACE participants’ care,  such as family members, caregivers and  authorized representatives, because we  believed they should be fully aware of  the PO’s performance and level of  compliance with statutory and  regulatory requirements. We also  encouraged POs to make review results  available to other potential participants  and the public, for example, by  releasing a summary of the reports  online. We stated in the proposed rule  that posting comprehensive review  results online would satisfy PO  requirements under § 460.196(d).    
The following is a summary of the  public comments we received on the  proposed provisions regarding federal  and state monitoring and our responses  to comments.    
*Comment:* The majority of    
commenters supported our proposal to  no longer mandate an onsite audit every  2 years for every PO following the 3-  year trial period. However, while  supportive of our proposal to change  how often we audit POs following the  trial period, multiple commenters were  concerned with allowing POs to go too  long without an audit. These  

commenters thought that CMS should  set an outer limit (or maximum length  of time) that a PO can go without having  an audit. These commenters referenced  the frail population in PACE as a reason  to ensure that POs get an audit on a  regular basis. These commenters  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00049 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**25658 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

suggested a maximum length of time  between audits ranging from 3 to 6  

years.    
*Response:* We agree with the    
commenters that there should be a    
defined length of time that a PO can go  without an audit following the trial  period. We do not believe that a  

maximum time limit needs to be    
implemented through regulation as it is  an internal decision and we need  

operational flexibility to modify this  timeframe when necessary based on  how the PACE program changes through  the years. Therefore, we intend to  

implement internal guidelines to ensure  that POs are audited with an  

appropriate frequency, but not modify  the proposed regulatory text.  

Additionally, we believe by utilizing a  risk assessment for audit selection, we  will be able to appropriately safeguard  this frail population by targeting, as  

often as necessary, those POs that CMS  believes may present a higher risk to  participants’ health and safety.    
*Comment:* A few commenters,    
although not against us finalizing the  proposed regulatory changes to  

monitoring requirements, urged caution  in expanding the time between PACE  audits following the trial period. One  commenter mentioned that increasing  the time between audits would place a  heavier burden on SAAs. Another  

commenter mentioned that if a PO is  embarking on an expansion, the  

frequency of monitoring should increase  during this period of expansion.    
*Response:* We appreciate these    
commenters’ concerns. We understand  that some SAAs may choose to audit  POs more frequently if we decide not to  audit a particular PO for a number of  years. We believe this is an important  part of our partnership with the SAAs,  and encourage states to monitor POs as  often as they believe necessary. While  we may not continue to audit all  

organizations as frequently after the trial  period as we did prior to the  

implementation of this regulation, we  will continue frequent account  

management monitoring and quality  reporting for all POs. We believe that  this account management monitoring,  along with our risk assessment and  

audits, will help us maintain an    
appropriate level of oversight in PACE.  We also appreciate the comment  

regarding audits when POs are    
embarking on an expansion, and we will  retain authority to audit POs more    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
frequently if needed.    
*Comment:* Two commenters    
expressed concern with reducing the  number of onsite audits conducted by  CMS after the trial period. One  

commenter said reducing the number of  

onsite audits would be eliminating the  tools that are proven to work in  assessing quality of care. The other  commenter suggested that if we audit  less frequently, we should collect  documentation from the PO more  frequently to compensate.    
*Response:* While we understand these  commenters’ concerns, we are confident  that we will still conduct effective  oversight over POs even if we no longer  require onsite visits at least every 2  years. POs that present a higher risk to  participants will still be audited on a  more frequent basis. Only those  organizations that are assessed to be a  lower risk will go longer between  reviews. Additionally, while we may  audit an organization less frequently,  POs are still subject to routine account  management monitoring and quality  reporting. Additionally, the SAA may  audit or monitor POs as they see fit,  including requesting documentation  from POs between audits.    
*Comment:* Several commenters  requested clarification on the risk  assessment CMS intends to use to select  POs for audits. Commenters encouraged  CMS to be transparent in how we select  POs, including what performance  measures we will be using for the risk  assessment. Some commenters wanted  confirmation that the risk assessment  would not be arbitrary and would  utilize reasonable standards. Another  commenter wanted clarification on  whether the risk assessment would be  consistent from region to region. Lastly,  one commenter requested that  

grievances be considered in whatever  risk assessment is created.    
*Response:* We appreciate these  commenters’ questions and comments  concerning the risk assessment. We  believe that by utilizing a data based  risk assessment we will be able to  appropriately target POs for audit.  While we will strive to be transparent in  factors or performance standards we  will use for our risk assessment, this is  an internal tool that will likely change  slightly every year based on what CMS  PACE subject matter experts believe is  important. At a minimum, this  assessment tool will likely review data  related to grievances, complaints and  access to care and take into account  when the PO was last audited.  Additionally, the risk assessment will  likely include measures related to  performance level of the PO and any  referrals made by either CMS or the  SAA. While we do not intend to publish  the exact measures utilized in the risk  assessment, we anticipate including  information in an annual audit report  that will discuss the risk assessment for  PO audits at a high level, as well as the    
POs selected for audit in a given year.  The annual report may also include  summarized audit results, including,  common conditions/findings cited and  any audit scores applied based on  conditions cited. The annual report will  be released by us each year through an  HPMS memorandum to the industry.    
*Comment:* We received several  comments on our proposed use of  technology for conducting audits,  specifically using webinars to audit a  PO when we would not be onsite for the  audit. Most of the commenters  expressed support for our proposal to  use technology to conduct audits. These  commenters warned, however, that  while the use of technology is good, POs  are small and have limited resources,  and reminded us that not all  

organizations will be equipped to  handle webinar audits in the same way.  *Response:* Since PACE is a direct care  model, there are times when audits  must be conducted onsite. However,  allowing the use of webinar technology  would allow us to conduct  

comprehensive reviews of a PO’s ability  to provide care and services, through  review of participant health records,  appeals, grievances, and other key  program areas. We recognize that most  POs are small, and some do not have the  sophisticated electronic systems of some  larger organizations. Auditors will work  within the systems that POs have when  conducting audits.    
*Comment:* One commenter questioned  if webinar use would mean that auditors  would no longer need remote access to  POs’ systems, like electronic health  records.    
*Response:* While we believe that the  use of webinars would reduce the  instances where auditors may need  remote access to review participant  records, there may still be instances  where remote access is needed. Among  other factors, because POs are direct  care models, auditors are sensitive to  the amount of time PO staff is required  to spend conducting the audit and away  from providing care to participants.  Therefore, auditors may determine that  conducting portions of the audits  through remote access, rather than  through a webinar, would be more  beneficial to the PO and participants.    
*Comment:* One commenter opposed  our proposed removal of specific  program elements from the regulation  that might be reviewed while onsite  during the trial period audits,  

specifically marketing, enrollment and  disenrollment procedures, participant  services, grievances and appeals.  *Response:* We appreciate this  

commenter’s concerns, however, the  removal of the specific elements from  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00050 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25659**  

the regulation text does not mean we  will no longer be reviewing those  

elements, either during the trial period  or during routine audits. While we are  eliminating the reference to specific  portions of the regulation, it remains our  intent that audits are comprehensive  reviews of a PO’s compliance with  

PACE regulations. A key part of that  review will be focused on participant  records, and all other services relating to  a participant’s experience and access to  care which may continue include  

review of marketing, participant    
services, enrollment and disenrollment  procedures, and grievances and appeals.  *Comment:* One commenter questioned  if CMS intends to release a new PACE  manual and audit guide after this rule  is finalized.    
*Response:* After publication of this    
final rule, we intend to update the PACE  manual to reflect the new rules,  

including the monitoring section of the  manual. The PACE audit protocol  

(guide) was revised in 2017 and was  posted for public comment through the  Paperwork Reduction Act process.  

Following publication of the final rule,  both the PACE audit protocol and  

internal auditor instructions will be  assessed and updated as needed. The  current PACE audit protocol is available  at *https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/*  

*Compliance-and-Audits/Part-C-and Part-D-Compliance-and-Audits/PACE*\_ *Audits.html.*    
*Comment:* One commenter expressed  a concern with for-profit POs, and  

recommended for-profit organizations  should be audited more often than not for-profit organizations.    
*Response:* For purposes of auditing    
following the trial period, POs that are  selected for audit will be selected using  a risk assessment tool that assesses a  number of factors related to PACE  

performance. We do not intend to select  POs based on for-profit or not-for-profit  status.    
*Comment:* One commenter requested  that we make auditors aware of the  

differences between MA and Part D  plans and POs.    
*Response:* We agree that PACE is a    
unique program as both a payer and  direct care provider. PACE auditors are  trained to understand the unique nature  of the PACE program prior to  

conducting any audits.    
*Comment:* One commenter    
encouraged CMS to conduct transparent  exit interviews at the conclusion of a PO  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
audit.    
*Response:* We agree that we should    
always strive to be transparent with our  audits, including conducting exit  

conferences to discuss conditions of  non-compliance with the PO prior to  

auditors concluding the audit. Our audit  process was revised in 2017 and the  new audit protocol for PACE was  approved under the Paperwork  Reduction Act approval process. This  new audit process includes conducting  exit interviews following the CMS audit  in order to ensure we are transparent  regarding the potential non-compliance  noted during the review.    
*Comment:* Multiple commenters were  supportive of our proposed revision to  the requirements for disclosure of the  results of PO reviews. Several of these  commenters supported our proposal  that POs be responsible for making the  review results available for examination  in a place that is readily accessible to  not only participants, but also their  family members, caregivers, and  authorized representatives. A few  commenters, while supportive of the  disclosure requirements, thought CMS  should be responsible for posting the  results of the review so that all  consumers can make an informed  decision about their PACE program.    
*Response:* We agree that disclosing  audit results to more than just  

participants is important, particularly  for family members, caregivers, and  authorized representatives that are  responsible for making informed  decisions regarding appropriate health  care. We appreciate commenters’  support for our proposal to require POs  to make these disclosures. We also  appreciate the benefits of CMS reporting  some results at a national level in order  to continue promoting improvements  across the industry, and allowing  participants and others to make  informed decisions.    
We published our first annual audit  report in 2018 which summarized audit  results from the 2017 audit year,  including common conditions/findings,  and provided a general overview of the  audit structure. That report is available  at *https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/  Compliance-and-Audits/Part-C-and Part-D-Compliance-and-Audits/PACE*\_ *Audits.html.* As noted previously in this  final rule, we anticipate this report will  continue to be released to the industry  via HPMS annually and will include not  only summarized information regarding  common conditions, but information  specific to individual POs as well,  including audit scores.    
*Comment:* Two commenters    
commented on the format of the  disclosed review results. One  

commenter encouraged CMS to make  reports as reader friendly as possible in  order to aid participants and family  members with understanding the  results. The other commenter requested  that results be published in a    
standardized manner to help    
participants and caregivers understand  them.    
*Response:* We agree with the    
commenters that reports and results  should be standardized and in an easily  readable format. During our audit  redesign, we developed standardized  reports and will continue to refine them  based on continued audit experience  and PO feedback.    
*Comment:* One commenter    
encouraged CMS to not only disclose  audit results publicly, but also create a  rating system for POs based on quality  measures to help participants and their  caregivers in making informed  decisions.    
*Response:* We thank the commenter  for the suggestion. We believe requiring  POs to make audit results available to  caregivers will help caregivers,  participants and their families make  informed decisions about participants’  care. While we currently score POs’  performance in audits, and publish  those scores in an annual report, we do  not intend to develop a separate rating  system due to the unique nature and  structure of POs around the country.    
*Comment:* Several commenters, while  supportive of POs disclosing audit  results to participants and their families,  caregivers, and authorized  

representatives, were concerned that  audit reports are too negative. These  commenters stated that by focusing only  on a PO’s deficiencies, the disclosure of  these results skew or bias a participant  or a participant’s caregiver when  making a decision about care. These  commenters stated that the disclosure of  results should focus on positive aspects  of the organization, as well as  

deficiencies.    
*Response:* We understand the concern  presented by these commenters. CMS  audits are intended to assess a PO’s  compliance with PACE regulations and  manual guidance. Our audits focus on  those areas in the PO that are not in  compliance and need corrective action  implemented. Our audits also focus on  the participant experience and access to  care. POs are currently required to make  the results of these reviews readily  available to participants; however, we  believe that it is important that  caregivers, family members, and  authorized representatives are also able  to see these results.    
*Comment:* Some commenters offered  their support for our proposed  

modifications to clarify the    
circumstances when a PO must take  action to correct deficiencies identified  by CMS or the SAA.    
*Response:* We appreciate the support  for this proposal.

**25660 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

After considering the comments, we  are finalizing the changes to the federal  and state monitoring requirements as  proposed.  

*M. Subpart L—Data Collection, Record  Maintenance, and Reporting*  

1\. Maintenance of Records and    
Reporting of Data (§ 460.200)  

In accordance with sections    
1894(e)(3)(A) and 1934(e)(3)(A) of the  Act, § 460.200 requires POs to collect  data, maintain records, and submit  

reports, as required by CMS and the  SAA. Section 460.200(f)(1) states that a  PO must retain records for the longest  of the following periods: (i) The period  of time specified in state law; (ii) 6 years  from the last entry date; or (iii) for  

medical records of disenrolled    
participants, 6 years after the date of  disenrollment. We proposed to change  the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii)  and (iii) from 6 years to 10 years for  consistency with the statute of  

limitations under the False Claims Act  (31 U.S.C. 3731(b)(2)). For enrollee  

records, under § 460.200(f)(1)(ii) and  (iii), the 10-year requirements would  apply only to records of new and  

existing enrollees in the PO. We    
explained in the proposed rule that  Medicare Advantage requirements at  § 422.504(d), Medicare Part D  

requirements at § 423.505(d), and other  CMS programs’ record retention  

requirements, all conform to the statute  of limitations for the discovery of  

violations under the False Claims Act.  We also noted that POs that offer  

qualified prescription drug coverage  currently must comply with the  

Medicare Part D record retention    
requirement in § 423.505(d). In addition,  we stated that the 10-year record  

retention policy is also consistent with  recordkeeping requirements under the  Medicaid Drug Rebate Program  

(§ 447.510(f)). We proposed to extend  the 10-year record retention requirement  to all PACE records for consistency with  these programs and to ensure we have  proper oversight for investigating the  complex payment and other  

relationships associated with delivery of  Medicare and Medicaid benefits under  the PACE program.  

The following is a summary of the    
public comments we received on the  proposed provisions regarding data  collection, record maintenance and  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
reporting, and our responses to    
comments.  

*Comment:* One commenter supported  our proposal to change the PACE record  retention requirement from 6 to 10  

years.  

*Response:* We thank the commenter  for its support.    
*Comment:* One commenter requested  that CMS require POs to collect and  report participant data for several  ‘‘sociodemographic’’ factors, including  age, race, ethnicity, primary language,  gender identify, sexual orientation, in  connection with PACE quality policies.    
*Response:* We do not currently collect  this information from POs, but will take  this suggestion into account as we  consider future subregulatory guidance  or rulemaking on PACE quality  requirements.    
As a result of the comments, we are  making no changes to our proposal and  are finalizing the modifications to  § 460.200 as proposed.  

**IV. Provisions of the Final Rule**  

For the most part, this final rule  incorporates the provisions of the  proposed rule. Those provisions of this  final rule that differ from the proposed  rule are as follows:    
In section III.C.4. of this final rule,  Subpart B—PACE Organization  Applications and Waivers, we are  clarifying the timeframes for  

applications at § 460.20(c)(2).    
In section III.C.6. of this final rule, we  are clarifying the PACE waiver  submissions process at § 460.26.    
In section III.F.10. of this final rule,  we are revising the text to specify  expectations for agent/broker training at  § 460.82(e)(4).    
In section III.G.3. of this final rule,  regarding the IDT for PACE participants,  we are revising § 460.98(c)(1) to refer to  ‘‘primary care, including services  furnished by a primary care provider as  defined in § 460.102(c) and nursing  services’’.    
In section III.G.3. of this final rule, we  are not finalizing our changes to  § 460.104(d)(2) as proposed and will  maintain the current provision which  requires that the appropriate members  of the IDT, as identified by the IDT,  must conduct the in-person assessment.  We are however revising § 460.104(d)(2)  to specify that unscheduled  

reassessments may be performed using  remote technology in certain  

circumstances. Specifically, when a  participant or his or her designated  representative makes a request to  initiate, eliminate or continue a  particular service, the appropriate  members of the IDT, as determined by  the IDT, may use remote technologies to  conduct unscheduled reassessments  when the IDT determines that the use of  remote technology is appropriate and  the service request will likely be  deemed necessary to improve or  maintain the participant’s overall health    
status and the participant or his or her  designated representative agrees to the  use of remote technology.  

In section III.F.3. of this final rule, we  are finalizing the provisions related to  the compliance oversight program as  proposed at § 460.63 in part. We are not  finalizing the provision that would  require POs to audit and monitor their  operations, but we are finalizing the  provision that would require POs to  identify, respond to and correct non compliance and fraud, waste and abuse.  

In section III.F.2. of this final rule, we  are not finalizing the proposal to add a  new § 460.62(a)(8) specifying that the  governing body of the PO must have full  legal authority and responsibility for  adopting and implementing the  compliance oversight program.  

In section III J.1. of this final rule, we  are revising § 460.182(b)(3) to require  that the Medicaid capitation rate  provides for reasonable, appropriate and  attainable costs that are required under  the PACE program agreement for the  operation of the PO for the time period  and the population covered.  

**V. Collection of Information**    
**Requirements**  

Under the Paperwork Reduction Act  of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501 *et seq.*)  we are required to provide 60-day notice  in the **Federal Register** and solicit  public comment before a collection of  information requirement is submitted to  the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) for review and approval. To  fairly evaluate whether an information  collection should be approved by OMB,  section 3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA  requires that we solicit comments on the  following issues:  

• The need for the information  collection and its usefulness in carrying  out the proper functions of our agency.  

• The accuracy of our estimate of the  information collection burden.  • The quality, utility, and clarity of  the information to be collected.  • Recommendations to minimize the  information collection burden on the  affected public, including automated  collection techniques.  

On August 16, 2016 (81 FR 54692  through 54697), we solicited public  comment on each of these issues for the  following sections in the proposed rule  that contained information collection  requirements. As indicated below, we  received comments pertaining to the  IDT under § 460.102. Otherwise, no  PRA-related comments were received  and the provisions were adopted as  proposed.

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25661**  

*A. Wage Estimates*  

To derive average costs, we used data  from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’  May 2016 National Occupational  Employment and Wage Estimates for all  salary estimates (*www.bls.gov/oes/  current/oes*\_*nat.htm*). In this regard,    
Table 2 presents the mean hourly wage,  the cost of fringe benefits and support  costs (calculated at 100 percent of  salary), and the adjusted hourly wage  for the occupation code, 29–9000,  ‘‘Other Healthcare Practitioners and  Technical occupations,’’ in the  

occupational category 29–0000,  ‘‘Healthcare Practitioners and Technical  Occupations.’’ This code was selected  since it includes PO, CMS and State  staff working in healthcare but who do  not have specialist or technical  specialist titles.

*B. Proposed Information Collection  Requirements (ICRs)*  

1\. ICRs Regarding Global Change for  Quality Assessment and Performance  Improvement (Part 460\)  

This final rule replaces all references  to ‘‘quality assessment and performance  improvement’’ to read ‘‘quality  

improvement’’ in §§ 460.32(a)(9),    
460.60(c), 460.62(a)(7), 460.70(b)(1)(iii),  460.120(f), 460.122(i), 460.130(a),  

460.132(a) and (c)(3), 460.134(a),    
460.136(a), (b), (c), (c)(1) and (c)(2)    
460.138(b), and 460.172(c). The change  also affects the heading for subpart H  and the section headings for §§ 460.132,  460.134, and 460.136.  

For each PO, we estimate a one-time  burden of 1 hour at $62.38hr for  

technical staff to replace or amend    
existing written materials with the    
updated term. In aggregate, we estimate  an annualized burden of 41.3 hours  (\[124 PO ⋅ 1 hour\] ⎟ 3\) at a cost of $2576  (41.3 hr. ⋅ $62.38/hr). We are  

annualizing the one-time estimate since  we do not anticipate any additional  burden after OMB’s 3-year approval  period expires. The revised  

requirements and added burden have  been submitted to OMB for approval  under control number 0938–0790  

(CMS–R–244). This information request  is subject to renewal. The control  

number’s current expiration date is June  30, 2020\.  

2\. ICRs Regarding Application    
Requirements (§ 460.12)  

While § 460.12 sets forth general    
application requirements for an entity  seeking to become a PO, current  

regulations do not specify the process  for an existing PO to submit an    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
application to expand its service area  and/or add a new PACE center site. In  § 460.12(a), we proposed revisions to  specify that this section also applies to  expansion applications. This change  would codify (in the CFR) the current  

PACE manual requirements pertaining  to application submissions.    
Until 2016 for initial PACE    
applications and 2017 for expansion  applications, PACE applications were  submitted in hard copy format.  Applications were often hundreds of  pages long, expensive to reproduce and  transmit, and administratively  

inefficient. This rule finalizes our  proposal to add the phrase ‘‘in the form  and manner specified by CMS’’ under  § 460.12(a) when describing the  submission of a complete application to  CMS. This change provides flexibility in  the submission of applications,  supporting documentation, and CMS  notifications. With this change CMS  expects that PACE applications will be  submitted in a fully electronic  

submission process, thereby reducing  the expense of submitting a hard copy  application. CMS has successfully  transitioned other programs to a fully  electronic submission process, thereby  facilitating a more organized and  streamlined review.    
Section 460.12(b) requires that a PO’s  application must be accompanied by an  assurance (from the SAA of the state in  which the program is located) indicating  that the state considers the entity to be  qualified as a PO and is willing to enter  into a program agreement with the  entity. This rule also finalizes our  proposal under § 460.12(b)(2) to require  that an expansion application include  the state’s assurance that the state is  willing to amend the PACE program  agreement to include new PACE center  sites and/or expand its service area.  This change codifies the current PACE  manual provisions pertaining to the  practice of application submissions.    
Section 460.12(c)(1) requires that an  entity submitting an application to  become a PO or a PO submitting an  application to expand its service area  must describe the proposed service area  in its application. As this is current  practice, this action would not add any    
new burden to the applicants. To  become a PO, the requirement for an  entity to submit an application that  describes the proposed service area is  set out under § 460.22. The application  for a PO to expand its service area also  requires this information. The  

requirements and burden are currently  approved by OMB under control  number 0938–1326. Subject to renewal,  the expiration date specific to this  control number is December 31, 2021\.  

3\. ICRs Regarding the Submission and  Evaluation of Waiver Requests  (§ 460.26)  

Section 460.26 discusses the    
requirements to submit a waiver seeking  to modify a PACE program requirement.  Although current regulations require  that a waiver request be submitted to the  SAA for review prior to submitting to  CMS, we finalized our proposal to  reorganize the CFR text so it is clear that  both current POs and applicants must  submit a waiver request to the SAA  prior to submitting their request to CMS.  The reorganized CFR text also clarifies  that a waiver request may be submitted  with the application or as a separate  document. The requirements for  submitting a waiver request are being  clarified and are not changing our  currently approved burden estimates for  POs and applicants. The preceding  requirements and burden are approved  by OMB under control number 0938–  0790 (CMS–R–244, expires, June 30,  2020).  

4\. ICRs Regarding Notice of CMS  Determination on Waiver Requests  (§ 460.28)  

Section 426.28(a) discusses the  timeframes for CMS to make a  

determination and to send notification  about the approval or denial of a waiver  request. While current language requires  that CMS approve or deny a waiver  request within 90 days of receipt of the  request, we revised the requirement so  

VerDate Sep\<11\>2014 16:36 May 31, 2019 Jkt 247001 PO 00000 Frm 00053 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\\FR\\FM\\03JNR2.SGM 03JNR2   
**25662 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

that CMS must approve or deny a    
request after receiving a complete    
waiver request. Since CMS will request  additional information from the PO if a  waiver request is not complete, this  change is needed since it is not possible  to make an informed decision for  

approval or denial when important    
information is missing. This change will  help facilitate CMS’ ability to work with  the PO or applicant to ensure that the  request includes all necessary  

information. The change is not expected  to change the burden on POs and  

applicants. The requirements and    
burden are approved by OMB under  control number 0938–0790 (CMS–R–  244, expires June 30, 2020).  

5\. ICRs Regarding the PACE Program  Agreement (§ 460.32)  

Sections 460.32 and 460.180(b)    
require that PACE program agreements  specify the methodology used to  

calculate the Medicare capitation rate.  For the Medicaid capitation rates,  

however, the PACE program agreement  must specify the actual amount  

negotiated between the POs and the  SAA (§§ 460.32(a)(12) and 460.182(b)).  In this rule we are finalizing our  

proposal to amend § 460.32(a)(12) by  requiring that the program agreement  include the Medicaid capitation rates or  the Medicaid payment rate  

methodology. This would be in addition  to the current requirement to include  the methodology used to calculate the  Medicare capitation rate.    
Medicaid capitation rates are    
developed and updated by the states (in  negotiation with the POs) and approved  by CMS. Operationally, states submit  documentation to CMS to support their  proposed PACE Medicaid capitation  rates. CMS reviews the documentation  to ensure the proposed rates are in  

compliance with the requirements of  § 460.182 and provides the state with  written approval of the rates. The  

Medicaid capitation rates are then    
communicated to the POs by the state in  writing.    
Since current regulations require that  the PACE program agreement include  the Medicaid capitation rates, this also  requires that the PACE program  

agreement be updated to reflect the rates  each time they change, which for most  POs is annually. We do not believe it is  always practical or efficient to include  the actual Medicaid capitation rates in  the PACE program agreement. In    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
response, we finalized our proposal to  amend § 460.32(a)(12) by requiring that  the program agreement include the  

Medicaid capitation rates or the    
Medicaid payment rate methodology.  We do not estimate any additional  

burden to the PO or the state as a result  of this change. During the next regular  rate update, the PACE program  agreement may be revised to include the  state’s Medicaid payment rate  

methodology instead of the new rates.  This would have been an update that  would have already been required under  the current requirements at  

§ 460.32(a)(12). By removing the  requirement that PACE program  agreements be updated to include the  Medicaid capitation rates, we estimate  that each PO would save 30 minutes  annually. Therefore, we estimate an  aggregate annual reduction of 62 hours  (124 POs x 0.5 hr) at a savings of $3,868  (62 hr x $62.38/hr).    
The revised requirement and burden  have been submitted to OMB for  approval under control number 0938–  0790 (CMS–R–244, expires June 30,  2020).  

6\. ICRs Regarding a Governing Body  (§ 460.62)  

Section 460.62 focuses on the ability  of the PO’s governing body to provide  effective administration in an outcome based environment. While § 460.62(a)(7)  requires that a PO’s governing body be  able to administer a quality  

improvement program, this rule revises  this section by requiring that the PO’s  governing body must be able to  administer a quality improvement  program as described in the general rule  regarding quality improvement  programs found in § 460.130.    
Section 460.132 already requires that  the PO implement a quality  

improvement plan and that the  governing body must review the quality  improvement plan on an annual basis.  Revisions to § 460.62(a)(7) simply  clarify what quality improvement  program the PO’s governing body must  be able to administer. The burden  associated with the aforementioned  requirements is captured in § 460.132  which is approved by OMB under  control number 0938–0790 (CMS–R–  244, expires June 30, 2020).  

7\. ICRs Regarding the Creation of a  Compliance Oversight Program  (§ 460.63)  

In the proposed rule we proposed to  create a new section, § 460.63 that  would have required all POs to  implement compliance oversight  programs for their organizations that  was would parallel the existing  compliance program infrastructure  required of Part D plan sponsors. In  particular, we proposed requiring that  POs have compliance oversight  programs for their entire organization  with two compliance elements, 1\)    
internal monitoring and auditing, and 2\)  prompt response, investigation and  correction of non-compliance and fraud,  waste and abuse.  

As described in section III.F.3. of this  final rule, we received several  

comments related to underestimating  the burden on the proposed compliance  oversight program. Specifically,  commenters suggested that additional  staff and resources would be required to  implement the two proposed provisions  across the PO’s full operations. As a  result of these comments we are not  finalizing the proposal to require POs to  adopt compliance oversight  

requirements related to internal  monitoring and auditing but are  finalizing a new § 460.63 which requires  POs to have a compliance oversight  program for responding to compliance  issues, investigating potential  

compliance problems, and correcting  non-compliance and fraud, waste and  abuse.  

In the proposed rule, based on our  experience with the program we  estimated 150 hours to create training  materials and devote staff to  

implementing the new program. We  estimated this burden based on our  combined experience with compliance  programs in MA and Part D as those  programs, like PACE are structured so  that there is a single organization  responsible for the care of enrollees/  participants. We then used that  experience and modified it to account  for POs size and staffing. We believe  that given the size of most POs, a one time burden of 150 hours would be a  reasonable estimate on how long it  would take to ensure new program  materials were developed.  

In this final rule, because we are not  finalizing the requirement for POs to  adopt internal monitoring and auditing  we are reducing the 150 hour estimate  of the one-time burden for each PO by  a factor of 10\. In addition, since we  published the proposed rule, the  number of POs has increased from 119  to 124\.  

For each PO, we estimate a one-time  burden of 15 hours at $62.38/hr for  technical staff to create written training  materials and written procedures for the  expansion of a PO’s existing system of  responding to and correcting non compliance (that the PO previously  established in its role as a Part D plan  sponsor) to prospectively encompass all  of its PACE operations. In aggregate, we  estimate an annualized burden of 620  hours (\[124 PO ⋅ 15 hour\] ⎟ 3\) at a cost  of $38,676 (620 hr ⋅ $62.38/hr). We are  annualizing the one-time estimate since  we do not anticipate any additional

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25663**  

burden after OMB’s 3-year approval  period expires.    
To estimate the annual burden of    
reporting fraud and abuse, we assume  each PO would take 20 hours annually.  Therefore, the aggregate hourly burden  is 2,480 hr (124 POs ⋅ 20 hours), at an  aggregate cost of $154,702 (2,480 hr ⋅  $62.38/hr).    
The revised requirements and added  burden have been submitted to OMB for  approval under control number 0938–  0790 (CMS–R–244, expires June 30,  2020).  

8\. ICRs Regarding Personnel    
Qualifications for Staff With Direct    
Participant Contact (§ 460.64(a)(3))  

Section 460.64(a)(3) requires that    
employees or contractors of the PO who  have direct participant contact must  have 1 year of experience working with  a frail or elderly population. We  

amended this requirement by allowing  the PO to hire employees or contractors  with less than 1 year of experience  

working with a frail or elderly    
population as long as they meet all other  qualification requirements under  

§ 460.64(a) and receive appropriate    
training on working with a frail or    
elderly population upon hiring.    
Section 460.71 already includes    
requirements regarding training of staff  and competency evaluations for  

employees and contracted staff    
furnishing care directly to participants.  In this regard the revisions to  

§ 460.64(a)(3) do not have any effect on  the burden that is currently approved by  OMB under control number 0938–0790  (CMS–R–244, expires June 30, 2020).  

9\. ICRs Regarding Program Integrity  (§ 460.68(a))  

Section 460.68 was established to    
guard against potential conflicts of    
interest or certain other risks    
individuals and organizations could  present to the integrity of the PACE  program. The amendments to  

§ 460.68(a)(3) enable POs to determine  whether an individual’s contact with  participants would pose a potential risk  because the individual has been  

convicted of criminal offenses related to  physical, sexual, drug, or alcohol abuse  or use, rather than entirely prohibiting  the hiring of such individuals. To  

provide POs with more safeguards    
against potential hires that may pose a  risk to participants, we also added  

language in § 460.68(a)(4) and (a)(5)  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
similar to the requirements found in  regulations governing Long Term Care  facilities.    
In § 460.68(a)(4), we finalized our    
proposal to add a new restriction that  would prevent POs from employing or  

contracting with individuals or  organizations who have been found  guilty of abusing, neglecting, or  mistreating individuals by a court of law  or who have had a finding entered into  the state nurse aide registry concerning  abuse, neglect, mistreatment of  residents, or misappropriation of their  property. Further, in § 460.68(a)(5) we  finalized our proposal to add a new  restriction that would prevent POs from  employing individuals or contracting  with organizations or individuals who  have been convicted of any of the  crimes listed in section 1128(a) of the  Act.    
We anticipate that these changes may  result in employers revising their  written policies and procedures related  to the hiring of individuals with  criminal histories and revising their  employment applications. We estimate a  one-time burden of 10 hr at $62.38/hr  for technical staff to make these  revisions to the written policies and  procedures. In aggregate, we estimate an  annualized burden of 413.3 hours (\[124  POs ⋅ 10 hr\]/3 yr) at a cost of $25,782  (413.3 hr ⋅ $62.38/hr). We are  

annualizing the one-time estimate since  we do not anticipate any additional  burden after OMB’s 3-year approval  period expires. The revised  

requirements and added burden have  been submitted to OMB for approval  under control number 0938–0790  (CMS–R–244, expires June 30, 2020).  

10\. ICRs Regarding Marketing (§ 460.82)  

Section 460.82 sets out requirements  governing the marketing activities of  POs. In this final rule, we are allowing  the use of non-employed agents/brokers,  provided they are appropriately trained,  to market PACE programs. We also  finalized our proposal to expand the  scope of prohibited marketing practices  to include additional means of  marketing through unsolicited contact.  In addition, we finalized our proposal to  remove § 460.82(f) which requires that  POs establish, implement, and maintain  a documented marketing plan with  measurable enrollment objectives and a  system for tracking its effectiveness. We  no longer believe that the documented  marketing plan is necessary as we  already review all marketing materials  used by a PO and enrollments are  already tracked by CMS. We do not  believe that a marketing plan is an  integral piece of the PACE program and  does not provide value to the PO or to  CMS. In response, we anticipate that  these changes may result in POs  needing to review existing policies and  procedures to make sure they  

incorporate the changes, as well as to  update any current marketing materials    
that may need to be changed as a result  of the regulatory changes.  

We estimate a one-time burden of 5 hr  at $62.38/hr for technical staff to revise  the written marketing policies and  materials. In aggregate, we estimate an  annualized burden of 206.7 hours (\[124  POs ⋅ 5 hr\]/3 yr) at a cost of $12,894  (206.7 hr ⋅ $62.38/hr).  

At the same time, we estimate a  burden reduction related to removing  the requirements for the marketing plan  and the tracking system. We estimate  this will save each PO 10 hours  annually. We estimate an aggregate  reduction of 1,240 hours (124 POs ⋅ 10  hr) at a savings of $77,351 (1,240 hr ⋅  $62.38/hr).  

We are annualizing the one-time  estimates since we do not anticipate any  additional burden after OMB’s 3-year  approval period expires. The revised  requirements and burden have been  submitted to OMB for approval under  control number 0938–0790 (CMS–R–  244, expires June 30, 2020).  

11\. ICRs Regarding the IDT (§ 460.102)  

Section 460.102 currently states that  primary medical care must be furnished  to a participant by a PACE primary care  physician. This final rule will allow  primary care to be furnished by a  ‘‘primary care provider’’ rather than a  ‘‘primary care physician.’’ The PO must  revise or develop policies and  

procedures for the oversight of its  primary care providers.  

This final rule permits a PO to have  one individual fulfill two separate roles  on an IDT when the individual meets  applicable state licensure requirements  and is qualified to fill each role and able  to provide appropriate care to meet the  participant’s needs.  

In response to public comments to  proposed rule CMS–4168–P, this final  rule further revises § 460.102 to delete  

the requirement that members of the  IDT must serve primarily PACE  participants.  

We estimate a one-time burden of 1 hr  at $62.38/hr for technical staff to update  their PO’s policy and procedures. In  aggregate, we estimate an annualized  burden of 41.3 hr (\[124 POs ⋅ 1 hr\]/3 yr)  at a cost of $2,576 (41.3 hr ⋅ $62.38/hr).  We are annualizing the one-time  estimate since we do not anticipate any  additional burden after OMB’ 3-year  approval period expires. The revised  requirements and added burden have  been submitted to OMB for approval  under control number 0938–0790  (CMS–R–244, expires June 30, 2020).

12\. ICRs Regarding Participant    
Assessment (§ 460.104)  

Section 460.104 sets forth the    
requirements for PACE participant    
assessments. The information obtained  through the assessment is the basis for  the plan of care developed by the IDT.  If the IDT determines from its  

assessment that certain services do not  need to be included in the participant’s  care plan, revisions to § 460.104(b)  

would require that the IDT must    
document in the care plan the reasons  why such services are not needed and  are not being included in the plan.    
As both the development of and    
updates to the care plan are a typical  responsibility for the IDT we believe  that any burden associated with this  would be incurred by persons in their  

normal course of business. We believe  that the burden associated with the  development of and updates to the care  plan are exempt from the PRA in  

accordance with 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2)  because the time, effort, and financial  resources necessary to comply with  these requirements would be incurred  by persons in the normal course of their  activities and is a usual and customary  business practice.    
Currently, § 460.104(c) sets forth the  requirements for periodic  

reassessments, including semiannual  and annual reassessments. In this rule  we are finalizing our proposal to remove  the requirement in § 460.104(c)(2)  

requiring annual reassessments by the  physical therapist, occupational  

therapist, dietician, and home care    
coordinator. In addition to the periodic  reassessments, § 460.104(d) sets forth  the requirements for unscheduled  

reassessments. In this final rule, we are  revising § 460.104(d)(2) to specify that  the appropriate members of the IDT may  use remote technologies to conduct  unscheduled reassessments when a  participant or his or her caregiver or  designated representative makes a  

request to initiate, eliminate or continue  a particular service, and the IDT  

determines that the use of remote    
technology is appropriate and the    
service request will likely be deemed  necessary to improve or maintain the  participant’s overall health status and  

the participant or his or her designated  representative agrees to the use of  

remote technology.    
While these requirements involve a  collection of information, we believe  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
that the burden associated with these  requirements is exempt from the PRA in  accordance with 5 CFR 1320.3(b)(2). We  believe that the time, effort, and  

financial resources necessary to comply  with these requirements would be  

incurred by persons in the normal  course of their activities and in the  absence of federal regulation.  

13\. ICRs Regarding Plan of Care  (§ 460.106)  

Section 460.106(a) requires that a  participant’s plan of care be developed  by the IDT promptly. This final rule  amends this requirement by specifying  that the IDT must develop the plan of  care within 30 days of the participant’s  date of enrollment. In § 460.106(b), we  finalized the following three new  requirements pertaining to the content  of the plan of care: (1) The plan must  utilize the most appropriate  

interventions for each of the    
participant’s care needs that advances  the participant toward the measurable  goals and desired outcomes; (2) the plan  must identify each intervention and  how it will be implemented; and (3) the  plan must identify how each  

intervention will be evaluated to  determine progress in reaching specified  goals and desired outcomes.  

We believe these changes provide  clarification regarding the current  requirements in § 460.106 on how to  develop and implement a plan of care,  and document any changes made to the  plan of care in the participant’s medical  record. We expect POs to keep up-to date with current practice standards  related to plans of care and believe that  most POs already implement these  requirements. As we stated in the 1999  IFC (64 FR 66276), the development of  the plan of care is subject to the PRA;  however, we stated that the burden  associated with this revision is exempt  from the PRA in accordance with 5 CFR  1320.3(b)(2) because the time, effort,  and financial resources necessary to  comply with these requirements would  be incurred by persons in the normal  course of their activities and in the  absence of federal regulation.  

14\. ICRs Regarding Explanation of  Rights (§ 460.116)  

Section 460.116 sets forth    
requirements for POs with respect to  explanation of rights, such as having  written policies and procedures on  these rights, explaining the rights, and  displaying the rights. Section  

460.116(c)(1) provides that the PO must  write the participant rights in English  and in any other principal languages of  the community. In this rule we are  finalizing our proposal to require that if  a state has not established a standard for  making the principal language  

determination, a principal language of  the community is any language spoken  regularly at home by at least 5 percent    
of the individuals in the PO’s service  area.    
We anticipate that these changes may  result in technical staff revising  documents. We estimate a one-time  burden of 5 hr at $62.38/hr for technical  staff to revise the written material about  participant rights. In aggregate, we  estimate an annualized burden of 206.7  hours (\[124 POs ⋅ 5 hr\]/3 yr) at a cost  of $12,894 (206.7/hr ⋅ $62.38/hr).  Section 460.116(c)(2) states that the PO  must display the participant rights in a  prominent place in the PACE center. In  this rule we are finalizing our proposal  to add the word ‘‘PACE’’ before the  words ‘‘participant rights’’ to specify  that participant rights specific to PACE  must be displayed.    
We anticipate that these changes may  result in technical staff revising  documents. Since the only change is the  addition of the word ‘‘PACE’’ and  redisplay of notices, we estimate a one time burden of 0.5 hr at $62.38/hr for  technical staff to revise the notices. In  aggregate, we estimate an annualized  burden of 20.7 hours (\[124 POs ⋅ 0.5  hr\]/3 yr) at a cost of $1,291 (20.7 hr ⋅  $62.38/hr).    
We are annualizing the one-time  estimates since we do not anticipate any  additional burden after OMB’s 3-year  approval period expires. The revised  requirements and added burden have  been submitted to OMB for approval  under control number 0938–0790  (CMS–R–244, expires June 30, 2020).  

15\. ICRs Regarding Quality    
Improvement General Rule (§ 460.130)  

Section 460.130 requires a PO to  develop, implement, maintain, and  evaluate a quality assessment and  performance improvement program  which reflects the full range of their  services. Section 460.140 refers to  additional quality assessment activities  related to reporting requirements. In this  rule we are finalizing our proposal to  combine § 460.140 with § 460.130 in an  effort to combine all the general rules  for quality improvement under the first  section in subpart H, and would entirely  remove § 460.140. This regulatory  reorganization has no impact on any  requirements or burden estimates.  

16\. ICRs Regarding Quality Performance  Reporting (§ 460.132)  

Section 460.132 sets forth    
requirements with respect to a Quality  Assessment and Performance  

Improvement (QAPI) plan. In this rule  we are finalizing our proposal to revise  § 460.132(a) and (c)(3) by referring to a  

quality improvement (QI) plan.  Revisions would also require that POs  have a written quality improvement

plan that is collaborative and    
interdisciplinary in nature. Because POs  are already required to have a written  QAPI plan, we anticipate added burden  to update the plan by making it more  collaborative and interdisciplinary in  nature.    
We estimate a one-time burden of 1  hour at $62.38/hr to update material. In  aggregate, we estimate an annualized  burden of 41.3 hours (\[124 POs ⋅ 1 hr\]/  3 yr) at a cost of $2,576 (41.3 hr ⋅  

$62.38/hr) to update QI plans. We are  annualizing the one-time estimate since  we do not anticipate any additional  burden after OMB’s 3-year approval  period expires. The revised  

requirements and added burden have  been submitted to OMB for approval  under control number 0938–0790  

(CMS–R–244, expires June 30, 2020).  

17\. ICRs Regarding the Enrollment    
Process (§ 460.152)  

Section 460.152(b)(4) states that the  PO must notify CMS and the SAA if a  prospective participant is denied  

enrollment. In this rule we are finalizing  our proposal to add the phrase, ‘‘in the  form and manner specified by CMS’’  and to codify current practice in which  such notifications are submitted to CMS  and SAA electronically, noting that this  change would not revise any  

requirements or burden estimates. The  requirements and burden are approved  by OMB under control number 0938–  0790 (CMS–R–244). Subject to renewal,  the control number’s current expiration  date is June 30, 2020\.  

18\. ICRs Regarding the Enrollment    
Agreement (§ 460.154)  

Section 460.154 specifies the general  content requirements for the enrollment  agreement. Specifically, § 460.154(i)  states that the enrollment agreement  must provide notification that  

enrollment in PACE results in    
disenrollment from any other Medicare  or Medicaid prepayment plan or  

optional benefit. We require additional  enrollment agreement language stating  that if a Medicaid-only or private pay  PACE participant becomes eligible for  Medicare after enrollment in PACE, he  or she will be disenrolled from PACE if  he or she elects to obtain Medicare  

coverage other than from his or her PO.  We estimate a one-time burden of 1  hour at $62.38/hr to update enrollment  

materials. In aggregate, we estimate an  annualized burden of 41.3 hr (\[124 POs  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
⋅ 1 hr\]/3 yr) at a cost of $2,576 (41.3 hr  ⋅ $62.38/hr). We are annualizing the  one-time estimate since we do not  

anticipate any additional burden after  OMB’s 3-year approval period expires.  The revised requirements and added  

burden have been submitted to OMB for  approval under control number 0938–  0790 (CMS–R–244). Subject to renewal,  the control number’s current expiration  date is June 30, 2020\.  

19\. ICRs Regarding the Enrollment  Procedures (§ 460.156)  

While § 460.156(a) currently requires  that POs provide participants with,  among other items, stickers for the  participant’s Medicare and Medicaid  cards, we finalized our proposal to  revise this requirement such that POs  would no longer be required to provide  participants with stickers for their  Medicare and Medicaid cards. Instead,  POs would be required to include the  PO’s phone number on the participant’s  PO membership card.    
Since we would no longer require that  POs provide stickers for participants’  Medicare and Medicaid cards, we  estimate an annual decrease of 1 minute  for each organization. The aggregate  annual reduction is 2.1 hours (124 POs  ⋅ 1 minute/response) at a savings of  $131 (2.1 hr ⋅ $62.38/hr). The revised  requirements and burden have been  submitted to OMB for approval under  control number 0938–0790 (CMS–R–  244). Subject to renewal, the control  number’s current expiration date is June  30, 2020\.    
Additionally, we believe that the  burden associated with including the  phone number of the PO on the PACE  membership card is exempt from the  

PRA in accordance with 5 CFR  1320.3(b)(2) because the time, effort,  and financial resources necessary to  comply with these requirements would  be incurred by persons in the normal  course of their activities and is a  customary business practice that would  occur in the absence of federal  regulation.  

20\. ICRs Regarding Involuntary  Disenrollment (§ 460.164)  

Section 460.164 specifies the    
conditions under which a PACE  participant can be involuntarily  disenrolled from a PACE program,  including when a participant engages in  disruptive or threatening behavior. We  have approved several waivers which  allow a PO to involuntarily disenroll a  participant in situations where the  participant’s caregiver engages in  disruptive or threatening behavior. In  this rule we are finalizing our proposal  to permit involuntary disenrollment in  situations where the participant’s  caregiver engages in disruptive or  threatening behavior, which is defined  as exhibiting behavior that jeopardizes  the participant’s health or safety, or the  safety of the caregiver or others.    
The revision would obviate the need  for such waivers, thereby reducing the  burden on POs, states, and CMS. Since  we continue to estimate that fewer than  10 POs would submit this type of  waiver request each year, we believe the  requirement is not subject to the PRA in  accordance with 5 CFR 1320.3(c)(4).  

21\. ICRs Regarding the Disclosure of  Review Results (§ 460.196)  

Section 460.196 requires that POs  make their review results available in a  location that is readily accessible to  their participants. In this rule we are  finalizing our proposal to amend  § 460.196(d) to ensure that POs make  review results available for examination  not just by PACE participants, but by  those individuals who may be making  decisions about PACE participants’ care,  such as family members, caregivers and  authorized representatives, because we  believe they should be fully aware of the  PO’s performance and level of  

compliance with statutory and  regulatory requirements.    
We anticipate that these changes may  result in technical staff redisplaying  documents. We estimate a one-time  burden of 0.5 hr at $62.38/hr for  technical staff to redisplay the review  results. In aggregate, we estimate an  annualized burden of 20.7 hours (\[124  POs ⋅ 0.5 hr\]/3 yr) at a cost of $1,291  (20.7 hr ⋅ $62.38/hr). We are  

annualizing the one-time estimate since  we do not anticipate any additional  burden after OMB’ 3-year approval  period expires. The revised  

requirements and added burden have  been submitted to OMB for approval  under control number 0938–0790  (CMS–R–244, expires June 30, 2020).  

22\. ICRs Regarding the Maintenance of  Records and Reporting of Data  

(§ 460.200)  

In accordance with § 460.200(f)(1),  POs must retain records for the longest  of the following periods: the period of  

time specified in state law; 6 years from  the last entry date; or for medical  records of disenrolled participants, 6  years after the date of disenrollment. In  this rule we are finalizing our proposal  to change this requirement from 6 to 10  years.    
We believe that the burden to store  records for 6 years is sufficient to cover  the storage for 4 more years, especially  

as data are increasingly likely to be  stored electronically. As for the storage  of electronic records, a server is not  needed since a terabyte hard drive costs  under $200 and can store a terabyte of  data securely. Furthermore, most servers  have additional capacity which could be  used before more expenses are needed.

**25666 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

Thus, the expense to go from 6 years to  10 years is minimal so we are not  itemizing this burden. The requirements  and burden for storing records for 6  

years are currently approved by OMB  under control number 0938–0790  (CMS–R–244, expires June 30, 2020).  The revised requirements have been  

submitted to OMB under this control  number for approval.

**VI. Regulatory Impact Statement**  

We have examined the impacts of this  final rule as required by Executive  Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning  and Review (September 30, 1993),  Executive Order 13563 on Improving  Regulation and Regulatory Review  (January 18, 2011), the Regulatory  Flexibility Act (RFA) (September 19,  1980, Pub. L. 96–354), section 1102(b) of  the Act, section 202 of the Unfunded  Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (March  22, 1995; Pub. L. 104–4), Executive  Order 13132 on Federalism (August 4,  1999), the Congressional Review Act (5  U.S.C. 804(2), and Executive Order  13771 on Reducing Regulation and  Controlling Regulatory Costs (January  30, 2017).  

Executive Orders 12866 and 13563  direct agencies to assess all costs and  benefits of available regulatory  alternatives and, if regulation is  necessary, to select regulatory  

approaches that maximize net benefits  (including potential economic,  environmental, public health and safety  effects, distributive impacts, and  equity). A regulatory impact analysis  (RIA) must be prepared for major rules  with economically significant effects  ($100 million or more in any 1 year).  

To analyze the impact of this rule we  reviewed its 45 provisions. We    
determined that 20 of the provisions  have no cost or savings so we are not  discussing them in this statement.  Twenty two other provisions are scored  in the information collection  

requirements section with aggregate  annualized burden (for the first 3 years)  of $176,486 ($257,836 in costs minus  $81,350 in savings). One of those 22  provisions, (the compliance oversight  provision), has effects outside of the  scope of the PRA, so the additional  impacts of it, and the remaining three  provisions are assessed in this  regulatory impact statement.  

The provision discussed in section  III.K.1. of this final rule, the  

modification of § 460.182 regarding  Medicaid payment, has no savings or  cost; the provision discussed in section  III.L.1. of this final rule, the  

modification of § 460.190 regarding  monitoring, has a savings of $1,523,253  to POs and a savings of $2,638,144 to  the government without any transfer to  POs; the provision discussed at III.G.4.  of this final rule, the modification of  § 460.104(d)(2) to allow use of remote  technologies for certain participant  assessments has a qualitative savings  which is not further quantified. It  follows that this final rule has a net  savings of 4 million arising primarily  from the monitoring provision. These  estimates are summarized in detail in  Table 4\. We discuss these four  provisions in more detail below.

**Notes:**    
1Positive numbers indicate savings; negative numbers indicate cost.    
2Although the Participant Assessment provision (Section III.G.4, § 460.104(d)(2)) is not scored quantitatively, it is a savings. The Medicaid pro vision is neither a savings nor cost. The additional flexibility for the IDT provision has neither cost nor savings to the government due to the fact  that most POs are currently exercising these flexibilities through PACE waivers.   
3The government saves $2,638,144 and the POs save $1,523,253.    
4The numbers in this row are derived from the summary Table 3 in the Collection of Information section as follows: The first year cost is  382,754 and is the sum of three items: (i) The aggregate of all items saved is $81,350, (ii) The annual cost of reporting fraud and abuse is  $154,702, (iii) the aggregate of all items with cost minus the $154,702 when multiplied by 3 is 309,402 (the numbers in Table 3 are divided by 3  to create an annualized cost and hence have to be multiplied by 3). The 2nd and later year costs are $73,352, the difference of $81,350 (the ag gregate of all items with savings) and the $154,702 annual cost of reporting fraud and abuse.  

*A. Medicaid Payment (§ 460.182  (Discussed in Section III.K.1. of This  Final Rule))*  

The provision aims to ensure that the  Medicaid rate paid under the PACE  program agreement is not only less than  what would otherwise have been paid  outside of PACE for a comparable  population, but is also sufficient for the  population served under the PACE  program, which we believed means not  lower than an amount that would be  reasonable and appropriate to enable the  PO to cover the anticipated service  utilization of the frail elderly  

participants enrolled in the program and  adequate to meet PACE program  requirements. We will continue to  review and approve Medicaid capitation  rates under PACE. Therefore, we do not  believe this provision will affect  spending.  

*B. Participant Assessment (§ 460.104(d)  Discussed in Section III.G.4 of This  Final Rule)*  

This provision reduces the required  IDT members at a ‘‘change in participant  status’’ reassessment under  

§ 460.104(d)(1) from 8 to 3 members and  allows use of remote technology to  conduct reassessments for certain  participant service requests under  § 460.104(d)(2). We expect the reduction  of required IDT members from eight to  three will result in savings by reducing  

labor costs. Similarly, we expect the use  of remote technology for reassessments  related to service delivery requests will  result in savings from reduced travel  costs for PO staff and PACE  

participants.    
We are scoring this as a qualitative  savings and not further quantifying it.  The primary reasons for not quantifying  it further are due to our inability to  assess the number of these participant  service requests and the typical travel  time that would have been required for  such reassessments. Furthermore,  removing a travel requirement for  requests might result in an increase in  requests and this effect is difficult to  quantify.  

*C. Monitoring (§ 460.190 (Discussed in  Section III.L.1. of This Final Rule))*  

This provision would result in  savings to both the POs and the  government without any transfers to the  POs. We estimate separately the savings  for POs and the government below.    
To estimate the savings from the  monitoring provision we use the  following assumptions, based on our  experience with audits. Since  

publishing the proposed rule, we have  implemented a new PACE audit  protocol. Having used that new protocol  for two years, we now have a better  understanding of the costs of audits to  both PO’s and the government. We are  updating our analysis to reflect our    
current projections, which result in  significantly increased estimated  savings for both POs and the  

government.  

Under the provision we are finalizing,  we estimate that we will perform 35  audits per year, 20 during PO trial  periods and 15 post trial period  (routine) audits. If we did not finalize  this provision, we estimate that we  would perform 72 audits per year, 34  during PO trial periods, and 38 post trial  period (routine) audits.  

In the proposed rule, we made the  following assumptions in estimating  costs of an audit for a PO. Mean hourly  wages have been updated to reflect  current estimates. The assumptions are  summarized in Table 5\.  

• *Personnel:* We estimated:  

\++ 2 Medical and Health Service  Managers, occupational code 11–9111  on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  website accessible at *www.bls.gov/oes/*  

*current/oes*\_*nat.htm,* with an average  hourly wage of $53.69  

\++ 1 Secretary and Administrative  assistant, code 43–6010, with an average  hourly wage of $19.74.  

However, in the time since the  proposed rule was published, CMS has  implemented and operated a new PACE  audit protocol which has allowed us to  better estimate the costs of audits on a  PO. We now estimate the following for  personnel:

**25668 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

Additionally, in the proposed rule we  estimated 80 hours uniformly per  person; 40 hours the week before the  audit and 40 hours the week of the  audit. Based on updated information,  we now estimate that audits will take  approximately 150 hours per person for  POs to complete. This estimate includes  all of the pre-audit work, including (i)  compiling and (ii) submitting audit  documentation; (iii) 2 weeks of audit    
fieldwork; the post-audit work of (iv)  collecting and (v) submitting impact  analyses, (vi) reviewing and (vii)  commenting on the draft audit report,  and (viii) submitting and (ix)  implementing corrective action plans  for conditions of non-compliance.  

• *Fringe benefits:* We estimate 100  percent (of hourly wage) for fringe  benefits and overhead.  

Based on these assumptions, we can  compute the difference between 72 and  35 audits per year. In the proposed rule,  we estimated that POs would save  approximately $737,336.00. However,  based on the new assumptions, and as  a result of more accurate estimates, we  now estimate that savings per year to  POs would be $1,523,253. The  calculations are exhibited in Table 6\.

In the proposed rule we used the  following assumptions to estimate the  cost of an audit for CMS.    
• 2.5 FTE (Between 2 and 3 per  audit). This number is based on CMS  experience across different geographic  regions some of which use 2 FTE and  some of which use 3 FTE.    
• *Hours spent:*    
\++ 220 hours at the GS–13 level with  an hourly average wage of $46.46  \++ 40 hours at the GS–15 level with  an hourly average wage of $64.59  Based on our experiences auditing POs  since publishing this proposed rule, we  are now using the revised assumptions:  

• 3 FTEs to conduct each audit and  1 FTE for audit oversight and 1 FTE to  conduct audit close out activities.  • *Hours spent:*    
\++ 220 hours at the GS–13 level with  an hourly average wage of $46.46  (includes 3 FTEs for 200 hours each and  1 FTE for 20 hours)    
\++ 60 hours at the GS–15 level with  an hourly average wage of $64.59  In the proposed rule, we estimated  that travel cost approximately $1,395  per audit. However, since this proposed  rule was published, we now estimate  that travel costs approximately $5,940  per audit.    
Finally, we continue to have the  following additional assumptions  related to government costs.  

• *Fringe Benefits:* We estimate 100  percent (of hourly wage) for fringe  benefits  

Based on these assumptions, we can  compute the difference between 72 and  35 audits per year. In the proposed rule,  we estimated that the savings to CMS  was $1,029,454.70 per year. Based on  the revised assumptions, we now  estimate the savings to the government  to be $2,638,144. The calculations are  exhibited in Table 7\.

*D. The Compliance Oversight Program  (§ 460.63 (Discussed in Section III.F.3. of  This Proposed Rule))*  

In the proposed rule, we pointed out  that current regulations do not require  POs to implement compliance programs  similar to those required in the  

regulations governing the MA and Part  D programs, and we proposed to adopt  certain compliance oversight  

requirements through the addition of  § 460.63.    
Currently, POs participating in the    
Part D program are required to have a  compliance plan with measures that  prevent, detect, and correct fraud, waste  and abuse as specified in  

§ 423.504(b)(4)(vi) governing the Part D  program. We proposed adopting PACE  program requirements that would result  in POs expanding their already existing  Part D compliance programs under the  Part D program to ensure compliance  oversight for the totality of the PO’s  operations. Specifically, we proposed to  require all POs to establish and  

implement compliance efforts geared  toward: (1) Routine monitoring and  identification of compliance risks and  (2) promptly responding to compliance  issues as they are raised, investigating  potential compliance problems as  

identified in the course of self   
evaluations and audits, correcting such  problems promptly and thoroughly to  reduce the potential for recurrence; and  ensuring ongoing compliance with CMS  requirements.    
In the proposed rule, we proposed a  burden associated with the  

requirements under § 460.63 which  would be the time and effort for each of  the 119 POs to develop, adopt, and  

implement procedures for conducting  internal auditing and monitoring to  ensure compliance with CMS program  requirements. POs would also be  

required to develop measures to detect,  correct, and prevent fraud, waste, and  abuse. POs will be required to devote  technical staff to developing and  

implementing these procedures.    
In the proposed rule, we estimated a  one-time burden of 150 hours at $59.44  per hour for technical staff to develop  the aforementioned procedures and  measures at an annualized cost of  

$353,668 (119 POs ⋅ 59.44/hour ⋅ 150/  3\) for each of the first 3 years. We  

estimated this burden based on our    
combined experience with compliance  programs in MA and Part D. Since we  jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
proposed to utilize two of the same    
compliance requirements in PACE as  are used in MA and Part D, we believe  this comparison will be accurate. We  then used that experience and modified  it to account for POs size and staffing.  

We believe that given the size of most  POs, a one-time burden of 150 hours  would be a reasonable estimate on how  long it would take to ensure new  program materials and measures were  developed.  

Additionally, once the program has  been developed and is running, we  indicated in our proposal that the PO  would have to spend some time going  forward monitoring their own  

compliance, and reporting and  responding to any suspected fraud,  waste and abuse. Therefore, in the  proposed rule, we estimated a burden of  200 hours at $59.44 per hour for  technical staff to complete these  activities including, when warranted,  revision of the aforementioned program  materials and monitoring measures. Our  estimate also included the routine  monitoring and identification of  compliance risks as identified in the  course of self-evaluations and audits.  We estimated total aggregate annual cost  at $1,414,672 (119 organizations ⋅ 200  hour ⋅ $59.44 per hour). Again, given  the size of POs and the limited number  of participants, we believed the burden  to be small, and we believed that 200  hours would cover the ongoing  responsibilities of each PO. This  includes PO monitoring of its own  compliance; corrective action as a result  of that monitoring; and updating PO  monitoring measures and procedures.  

We solicited comments from POs  regarding this burden estimate in the  proposed rule. The following is a  summary of the public comments we  received on the ‘‘Compliance Oversight  Program’’ proposed burden estimate and  our response to those comments.  *Comment:* Many commenters  

suggested that we underestimated the  burden of implementing a compliance  oversight program in PACE. These  commenters suggested more staff would  be needed, and the cost and hours to  both implement and maintain a  compliance oversight program were  underestimated. One commenter  suggested we use our burden estimates  for the monitoring proposal in Subpart  K in order to estimate the burden of POs  implementing an internal monitoring  and auditing program as a part of the  compliance oversight program, since the  same staff would likely be used. One  commenter mentioned that the time  involved in conducting ongoing internal  monitoring would be similar to the time  POs currently spend when undergoing a  CMS audit. Another commenter  mentioned that there would be a large  increase in manual data collection  which needed to be included in the  burden.    
*Response:* Based on comments  received, and because we have a strong  policy interest in not creating undue  burden, we have reviewed our proposed  provision and the proposed burden  associated with it. We believe that the  majority of the burden associated with  our initial proposal is due to the first  element of our proposal which would  have required POs to adopt internal  monitoring and auditing that would  cover all PACE operations. Because POs  are currently required to have a  compliance program as Part D plan  sponsors, we estimated the cost of new  PACE requirements would be to update  materials and expand efforts currently  in place under Part D to implement  these new PACE provisions and ensure  that the full PACE operations were  being affirmatively reviewed and that  compliance concerns identified  anywhere in the PO’s operation were  being promptly addressed. Although we  did not separately analyze the cost of  each of these two elements in our first  proposal, the majority of burden was  associated with the development and  implementation of the internal  monitoring and auditing element. We  are not finalizing that element at this  time in order to further evaluate the  anticipated burden. We are finalizing  the compliance oversight requirements  which require promptly responding to  non-compliance and fraud, waste and  abuse. Because we are not expanding  the scope of what an organization is  required to monitor and because we  believe POs are currently addressing  compliance concerns in their  

organizations as they arise outside of  Part D, we anticipate only a minimal  burden with this element. Therefore, we  revised our burden estimates and  decreased the hours to implement this  revised provision by a factor of 10\. The  number of hours would therefore be  reduced from 150 hours to 15 hours for  one staff member. Additionally, we  decreased the estimate of how many  hours an organization will spend  following the implementation of this  provision from 200 to 20 hours. We  decreased these numbers because we are  not finalizing the element that would  have required POs to expand their  internal monitoring and auditing efforts,  and we are only finalizing the provision  that would require an organization to  have a system for responding to,  investigating and correcting non compliance. Since there will be no  increased data collection, we believe  this reduced burden accurately reflects  the revised provision.  

As discussed above, and as a result of  these comments, we have decided not to

**25670 Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations  

finalize the first proposed element  related to internal monitoring and  auditing, and finalize only the second  element of the proposed compliance  oversight program, related to responding  to, correcting and reporting non compliance and fraud, waste and abuse.    
As in the proposed rule we make  separate estimates for the initial year    
and for subsequent years. Additionally,  since the proposed rule was published  the number of POs increased from 119  to 124\. Because we are not adopting the  element of the proposal that would have  required POs to establish internal  monitoring and auditing the estimates of  150 and 200 hours use in the proposed  

rule are reduced by a factor of 10\. Table  8 exhibits the estimates under the  proposed and final rule. As we are  finalizing, we estimate an initial year  burden of $116,026.80 (or $38,675.6 per  year for 3 years) and a subsequent  burden of $154,702.40 for later years.

Based on the above analysis, we have  determined that this final rule does not  reach the economic threshold, and  

therefore, it is neither an ‘‘economically  significant rule’’ under E.O. 12866, nor  a ‘‘major rule’’ under the Congressional  Review Act.    
The RFA requires agencies to analyze  options for regulatory relief of small  entities, if a rule has significant impact  on a substantial number of entities.  

However, as shown in Table 4, this final  rule has a net impact of savings, not  cost, and consequently, we are not  

preparing an analysis for the RFA    
because we have determined, and the  Secretary certifies, that our changes to  this regulation would not have a  

significant economic impact, nor net  additional costs requiring possible  

regulatory relief, on a substantial    
number of small entities.    
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act  requires us to prepare a regulatory  

impact analysis if a rule may have a  significant impact on the operations of  a substantial number of small rural  

hospitals. This analysis must conform to  the provisions of section 604 of the  

RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of  the Act, we define a small rural hospital  as a hospital that is located outside of  a Metropolitan Statistical Area for  

Medicare payment regulations and has  fewer than 100 beds. As previously  explained, this rule will allow for  

increased staffing flexibility among POs;  therefore, we are not preparing an    
jbell on DSK3GLQ082PROD with RULES2  
analysis for section 1102(b) of the Act  because we have determined, and the  Secretary certifies, that this final rule  

would not have a significant impact on  the operations of a substantial number  of small rural hospitals.  

Section 202 of the Unfunded    
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 also  requires that agencies assess anticipated  costs and benefits before issuing any  rule whose mandates require spending  in any 1 year of $100 million in 1995  dollars, updated annually for inflation.  In 2019, that threshold is approximately  $154 million This rule will not mandate  any requirements for state, local, or  tribal governments nor would it result  in expenditures by the private sector  meeting that threshold in any 1 year.    
Executive Order 13132 establishes  certain requirements that an agency  must meet when it promulgates a  proposed rule (and subsequent final  rule) that imposes substantial direct  requirement costs on state and local  governments, preempts state law, or  otherwise has federalism implications.  Under Executive Order 13132, this final  rule will not significantly affect the  states beyond what is required and  provided for under sections 1894 and  1934 of the Act. It follows the intent and  letter of the law and does not usurp  state authority beyond what the Act  requires. This rule describes the  processes that must be undertaken by  CMS, the states, and POs in order to  implement and administer the PACE  program.    
As noted previously, sections 1894  and 1934 of the Act describe a  

cooperative relationship between the  Secretary and the states in the  

development, implementation, and  administration of the PACE program.  The following are some examples of  areas in which we collaborated with  states to establish policy and procedures  for PACE, with references to the  relevant sections of the Act:    
(1) Establishing procedures for  entering into, extending, and  

terminating PACE program    
agreements—sections 1894(e)(1)(A) and  1934(e)(1)(A) of the Act;  

(2) Establishing procedures for  excluding service areas already covered  under other PACE program agreements  in order to avoid unnecessary  

duplication of services and impairing  the financial and service viability of  existing programs—sections  

1894(e)(2)(B) and 1934(e)(2)(B) of the  Act;  

(3) Establishing procedures for POs to  make available PACE program data—  sections 1894(e)(3)(A)(i)(III) and  1934(e)(2)(A)(i)(III) of the Act;  

(4) In conjunction with the PO,  developing and implementing health  status and quality of life outcome  measures for PACE participants—  sections 1894(e)(3)(B) and 1934 (e)(3)(B)  of the Act;  

(5) Conducting comprehensive annual  reviews of POs during the trial period—  sections 1894(e)(4)(A) and 1934(e)(4)(A)  of the Act;  

(6) Establishing the frequency of  ongoing monitoring—sections  

1894(e)(4)(B) and 1934(e)(4)(B) of the  Act;  

(7) Establishing a mechanism for  exercising enforcement authority—  sections 1894(e)(6)(A) and 1934(e)(6)(A)  of the Act.  

For this reason, prior to publishing  the 2006 final rule, we obtained state  input in the early stages of policy  development through conference calls  with state Medicaid agency  

representatives. The statute requires that  states designate the agency of the state  responsible for the administration of the

**Federal Register** / Vol. 84, No. 106 / Monday, June 3, 2019 / Rules and Regulations **25671**  

PACE program. Although the state may  designate the state Medicaid agency to  administer the PACE program, another  agency may be named. The eight  

agencies that volunteered to participate  in these discussions represented a  

balanced view of states; some with    
PACE demonstration site experience  and some who were not yet involved  with PACE, but were interested in  

providing input to establish a new long  term care optional benefit. The calls  were very productive in understanding  the variety of state concerns inherent in  implementing a new program. In  

addition, in order to formulate processes  to operationalize the PACE program, we  have maintained ties with state  

representatives through monthly    
conference calls to obtain information  on a variety of topics including the  

applications review and approval    
process, data collection needs, and    
enrollment/disenrollment issues. We are  committed to continuing this dialogue  with states to ensure this cooperative  atmosphere continues as we administer  the PACE program.  

Executive Order 13771, titled    
Reducing Regulation and Controlling  Regulatory Costs, was issued on January  30, 2017 and requires that the costs  

associated with significant new    
regulations ‘‘shall, to the extent    
permitted by law, be offset by the    
elimination of existing costs associated  with at least two prior regulations.’’  OMB’s interim guidance, issued on  

April 5, 2017, *https://*   
*www.whitehouse.gov/sites/*    
*whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/  2017/M-17-21-OMB.pdf,* explains that  ‘‘E.O. 13771 deregulatory actions are not  limited to those defined as significant  under E.O. 12866 or OMB’s Final  

Bulletin on Good Guidance Practices.’’  Accordingly, this final rule is  

considered an E.O. 13771 deregulatory  action. We estimate that this rule  

generates $3.3 million in annualized  cost savings, discounted at 7 percent  relative to year 2016, over a perpetual  time horizon.  

In accordance with the provisions of  Executive Order 12866, this regulation  was reviewed by the Office of  

Management and Budget.
