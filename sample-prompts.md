# Building Trust

A potential participant says they’re afraid of losing their independence if they join PACE.
Help me write a warm, reassuring response using the P.A.C.E. model that helps them feel respected and safe, while showing how PACE supports independence.

# Helping Caregivers w/PACE

Create an outreach message for adult children caring for aging parents who feel overwhelmed and unsure where to turn. Use a compassionate tone and explain how PACE helps families find relief and balance.

# Training Staff w/Objections

Create a short roleplay between an enrollment representative and a family caregiver who says: ‘My mom already has a doctor she likes. I don’t want to make her switch.’ Use both the Bridge Model and the P.A.C.E. model to show two different ways to respond.
